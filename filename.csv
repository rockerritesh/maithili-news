Joyous Ram devotees and members of the Indian diaspora around the world came together, including at the iconic Times Square in New York, for prayers, car rallies, cultural and other religious events along with live streaming to celebrate the consecration of 'Ram Lalla' in Ayodhya on Monday.

Nepal's Janakpurdham, the birthplace of goddess Sita, on Monday, decked up for the Ram Temple consecration ceremony, with temple authorities decorating the Janaki temple with garlands and flowers.

Hindus in Janakpurdham, who joined the celebrations with multiple cultural and religious festivities, wrote ""Jai Siyaram"" with flowers.

Lord Ram's wife Sita's other name is Janaki, daughter of King Janak of Janakpur. It is 500-odd kms east of Ayodhya in India and has been a symbol of the ancient bond shared by the two countries.

Houses and streets of Janakpur were decorated with colourful lights, paper flags, banners and garlands, local authorities said.

As many as 1.25 lakh earthen lamps were lit to celebrate the auspicious occasion of 'pran pratistha'.

The Indian diaspora gathered at New York's Times Square to witness the live screening of the 'Pran Pratistha' ceremony at Ram Mandir. The iconic location was lit up to mark the ceremony. People were seen donning traditional attire, dancing, singing bhajans and other songs.

At SV Lotus Temple in Fairfax County of Virginia, a suburb of Washington DC, members of the Sikh, Muslim and Pakistani American communities also joined the celebrations. Over 2,500 people attended the event coinciding with the consecration at Ayodhya.

Pictures of the Ram Mandir were also displayed on the NASDAQ screen.

At an event organised by the Hindus of Greater Houston, members from various countries where Lord Rama is part of the culture were facilitated.

In Los Angeles, 1,000 people attended a car rally to celebrate the occasion. About 250 cars participated in the rally.

Immediately after the inauguration of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya, the World Hindu Council of America (VHPA) and Vishwa Hindu Parishad of Canada announced a Ram Mandir Yatra to visit over 1,000 temples in the two countries.

The epic journey is scheduled to commence on March 25 from the Om Hindu Centre in Billerica, Massachusetts, featuring a specially adorned van carrying statues of Shree Ram, Sita, Lakshaman, and Hanuman, according to a statement issued by VHP America.

“The primary goal of this monumental endeavour is to personally deliver Prasad and Akshat (rice) obtained by VHPA delegates who actively participated in the Shree Ram Lalla Murti Prana Pratishtha in Ayodhya Dham on January 22, 2024,” it said.

“Additionally, the initiative aims to present written recognition of participation in the Shree Ram Lalla Murti Prana Pratishtha,” it said, adding, this ambitious task is set to be accomplished in 45 days, encompassing the entire expanse of the USA and Canada.

Thousands of people in Trinidad and Tobago, a Caribbean nation with a large Indian-origin population, attended a grand event on the eve of the consecration of 'Ram Lalla' in Ayodhya.

More than 5,000 people attended the celebration on Sunday which was marked by cultural events and the singing of popular Ram songs.

“Indeed, an honour to participate in the grand celebrations by the Indian Diaspora in Trinidad and Tobago on the eve of Pran Pratishtha of Shri Ram Lalla in Ayodhya,” the Indian High Commission in Trinidad and Tobago posted on X.

In Canberra, the members of Indian diaspora in Australia had gathered at a community event to witness live streaming of consecration of Ram Lalla at Ayodhya. Indian High Commissioner and several of his colleagues attended the event.

In United Kingdom, car rallies, community celebrations and cultural events marked the celebrations.

Car dressed up as 'rath' in London was part of a rally held ahead of the Ayodhya event while temples across UK, including the famous Ram Temple at South Hall in London, saw gatherings of the members of the diaspora. They organised langars to mark the occasion, held Ram Dhun and distributed laddoos.

The Mauritian government granted a one-off special leave for two hours to public servants of the Hindu faith to attend prayers marking the ""landmark"" inauguration.

""Let us rejoice as Shri Ram returns to Ayodhya. May his blessings and teachings light our way towards peace and prosperity. Jai Hind! Jai Mauritius!"" Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth posted on X.

Presenting the rustic melodies of Ram bhajans, the Roche Bois Ramayana Group from Mauritius created a heartwarming ambience that filled the air with devotion, peace, and a sense of unity.

The Indian community in Dubai celebrated the consecration ceremony of the new Ram Temple in Ayodhya by organising a cultural event where hundreds of members of the Indian diaspora performed traditional dances and sang devotional songs to mark the occasion.

On the eve of the ‘Pran Pratishtha' ceremony at Ayodhya, Queretaro in Mexico got the first Lord Ram temple. Queretaro also hosts the first Lord Hanuman temple in Mexico.

""The ‘Pran Pratishtha' ceremony was performed by an American Priest with Mexican hosts & the idols brought from India. The atmosphere was filled with divine energy as the hymns & songs sung by the Indian diaspora reverberated throughout the hall,"" the Embassy of India in Mexico posted on X.

Over 250 diaspora members attended the event.

In Fiji, Ram Lalla Utsav was organised from January 18-22 by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations in Suva and Shree Sanatan Dharm Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji to commemorate the inauguration.

Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) is an independent, volunteer-based, and nonprofit humanitarian organization established in 1963. It was recognized by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 1964 and affiliated to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) in the same year. NRCS has, over the years, grown to be the largest humanitarian organization in the country with a network of 7 province committees, 77 district chapters, and 1,556 sub-chapters at grassroots level. At present, NRCS is delivering its organizational and community-based services by mobilizing more than 100,000 volunteers and 1.2 million members in addition to over 500 professional staff.

NRCS has been delivering humanitarian assistance like disaster risk management, healthcare, community development as well as its flagship services including blood transfusion, ambulances, first aid, eye care, humanitarian value promotion and so on across the country. In this initial phase of the establishment, NRCS had primarily focused on disaster relief, gradually expanding its capacity and services; NRCS engaged in emergency preparedness and response, communitybased disaster risk reduction, and management programs ensuring participation from the community. Considering the evolving risk patterns, NRCS as a humanitarian organization, is engaged to address those evolving risks through its services to achieve global and national target of sustainable development Goals (SDGs), Sendai Framework for Disaster Risks Reduction (SFDRR), and Paris agreements. NRCS has always aspired to be a partner of choice for the beneficiaries and its partners while expanding its service areas. NRCS has been rolling out organizational policies, strategies, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and plans, ensuring alignment with national and international priorities.

Towards this end, NRCS has developed and implemented its eight-development plan (2021-2025) focusing on four strategic objectives, which are a) Governance and Organizational Development, b) Disaster and Crisis Management, c) Health and Community Care and d) Humanitarian Principles, Values, International Laws, and Diplomacy. In the context of NRCS’s strategic focus on disasters and crises and increasing humanitarian consequences of climate risks, the climate and environment policy will provide strategic direction and guidance on addressing various dimensions of climate and environmental risks in Nepal.","{'https://news.google.com/themes/custom/common_design_subtheme/img/logos/rw-logo-desktop.svg', 'https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/previews/13/17/1317986f-8517-4257-ab02-87ae9951288d.png', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/small/public/previews/13/17/1317986f-8517-4257-ab02-87ae9951288d.png?2489999-1-0'}"

Nepal is among the highly vulnerable country to climate change and other forms of disasters.

Nepal along with the Himalayan Region has witnessed rapid rise of temperature and uncertainties in precipitation patterns. Nepal climate outlook study carried out in 2018 has projected that the average annual mean temperature will increase by 0.9–1.1 degrees Celsius (o C) in the medium-term period (2050) and 1.3 – 1.8oC in the long-term term (2100). Likewise, the average annual precipitation is likely to increase by 2–6% in the medium-term and 8–12% in the long-term period .

Paths of achieving targets of climate risk reductions come with challenges that include knowledge and data gaps, absence of enabling policy environment, inadequate financial and technical resources, and institutions. Some others fall in unknown category such as unanticipated political and economic crises that coincide with climate extremes. In order to reduce high vulnerability of a large section of Nepali population to climate risks with extremely low adaptive capacity, there is a need of concerted efforts on building our infrastructures, institutions, knowledgebase, and technological innovations.

Nepal is recognized as a pioneer country in framing community-based adaptation responses to climate change. A vast pool of knowledge and technologies are already available on DRR and CCA domains at different levels – local, national, and international. For example, community managed flood early warning systems, and local adaptation plan of action (LAPA) are among the tested technologies and approaches that have worked effectively. Geo-physical vulnerability maps and areas of highly vulnerable populations are being developed. There is a need to blend good practices from diverse domains into an integrated form of climate risk management. Relevant policies, plans and commitments of the Government of Nepal also highlight several priorities with regards to climate change and environment, as presented in below table.

The NRCS is one of the largest humanitarian organizations in Nepal and is recognized as the lead agency in humanitarian assistance and community care, as mandated by its auxiliary role to the public authorities of Nepal. NRCS has positioned itself in the diverse community services and working on the front line of any humanitarian crises maintains a strong collaboration with the government and communities in need both as the partner and beneficiaries. To this aspect, the nexus of environmental degradation and climate change impacts often creates a complex nature of vulnerability that needs special attention and preparedness to respond to humanitarian crises.","{'https://news.google.com/themes/custom/common_design_subtheme/img/logos/rw-logo-desktop.svg', 'https://reliefweb.int/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/previews/de/5e/de5e79f2-0052-413b-bd22-5ba78a0c4e32.png', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/styles/small/public/previews/de/5e/de5e79f2-0052-413b-bd22-5ba78a0c4e32.png?2490005-1-0'}"

Devotees lit 2.5 lakh oil lamps in Janakpur, the home town of Goddess Sita, to celebrate the Pran Pratishtha of Ram Lalla idol in Ayodhya on Monday evening.

The ancient city where King Janak, Father of Goddess Sita used to rule had started preparing for the celebration weeks before. The city is glowing with lamps and colorful decorations celebrating the homecoming of the son-in-law.

Local groups had begun a campaign to collect all required and possible items such as diya, pala, oil and cotton lamps. Apart from it, a rangoli reading ""Jai Siyaram"" also was made using flowers and vermillion powders.

In the visuals captured by ANI drone, the light from 2.5 lakh oil-fed-lamp with Janaki Temple on background and surrounded by devotees looked mesmerizing. It took about an hour to light up all the lamps and get to the glory which shined brightly as seen through the bird's eye view.

Earlier in the day, rallies and celebratory events were held in the ancient city along with the screening of the Pran Pratistha of Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Janakpur, the Chief Mahanth along with the Chotte Mahanth had attended the ceremony.

The idol of Shri Ram Lalla was unveiled in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Ayodhya who later led the rituals at the Pran Pratishtha ceremony in the sanctum sanctorum of the grand temple.

The magnificent Ram Temple is constructed in traditional Nagara style. Its length (east-west) is 380 feet; width 250 feet and height is 161 feet; and is supported by a total of 392 pillars and 44 doors.

The pillars and walls of the temple showcase intricately sculpted depictions of Hindu deities, gods, and goddesses. In the main sanctum sanctorum at the ground floor, the childhood form of Bhagwan Shri Ram (the idol of Shri Ramlalla) has been placed.

The main entrance to the Mandir is situated on the eastern side, which can be approached by ascending 32 stairs through the Singh Dwar. There are a total of five Mandaps (Halls) in the Mandir - Nritya Mandap, Rang Mandap, Sabha Mandap, Prathana Mandap and Kirtan Mandap.

Near the Mandir is a historic Well (Sita koop), dating back to the ancient era. In the southwestern part of the Mandir complex, at Kuber Tila, the ancient Mandir of Bhagwan Shiv has been restored, along with the installation of a statue of Jatayu.

The idol of Lord Ram has been placed inside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple in Ayodhya. The idol of Ram Lalla is carved by Mysuru-based sculptor Arun Yogiraj. The idol is 51 inches tall and weighs 1.5 tons. The idol portrays Lord Ram as a five-year-old child standing on a lotus also crafted from the same stone.

Notable ceremonies took place at the iconic Nallur Kovil temple, a significant Hindu temple in the Jaffna district. Devotees gathered at temples, engaging in rituals, cleaning holy statues, and offering prayers. Officials from the Indian Consulate attended the events, signifying the cross-border cultural and religious connection.In Nepal's Madhesh province, the birthplace of goddess Sita, people celebrated with enthusiasm the consecration of 'Ram Lalla' in Ayodhya. Janakpurdham, a city in Nepal symbolic of the ancient bond shared with India, witnessed elaborate festivities. The Janaki temple was adorned with garlands and flowers, and locals participated in cultural and religious events. In Janakpurdham, known for its deep connection to the Ramayana, houses and streets were decorated with lights, flags, banners, and garlands. The occasion was marked by the lighting of 1.25 lakh earthen lamps, symbolising the auspiciousness of 'pran pratishtha.'The celebration extended to Sarlahi district in Madhesh province, where people illuminated their houses, held religious processions, and offered prayers at major temples. The festivities spanned across eight districts in Madhesh province, including Dhanusha, Mahottari, Sarlahi, Siraha, Saptari, Bara, Parsa, and Rautahat. Additionally, people from districts adjoining the Indian border also joined the celebrations, emphasising the cultural unity and shared reverence for Lord Ram and Goddess Sita.Ayodhya transformed into a spectacular sight as over 100 private jets descended, and Indian Air Force (IAF) choppers showered rose petals, marking the grand celebration of Ram Lalla's consecration. The 560-metre-long Janmabhoomi Path, adorned with flower arrangements, guided the way to the temple complex. Along a 10-km stretch, sixty stages featured artists from diverse Indian musical traditions, contributing to the festive atmosphere.The townspeople played a pivotal role, actively participating in the historic festivities. They contributed to the celebration by offering flowers, conducting aartis, and distributing sweets. As darkness fell, Ayodhya came alive with the glow of tens of thousands of diyas, creating a mesmerising spectacle along the Sarayu riverbanks.Residents went above and beyond to share the joy. Many took to the streets, offering food to everyone, irrespective of their means. Retired bankers organised community kitchens, and families with limited resources pooled money for 5-day bhandaras. Sound boxes resonated with Ram bhajans, and some residents expressed their joy through dance. The collective efforts of the townspeople added a special touch to the historic celebration.","{'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-13228,msid-107086028/whats-next-for-zee-entertainment.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-32348,msid-107083427/key-levels-to-watch-out-for-in-jan-24-session.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107064204,imgsize-140089,width-138,height-104,quality-100/markets/stocks/news/funds-from-ireland-luxembourg-norway-and-japan-raise-bets-on-indian-equities.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-106959240,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107056956,imgsize-39110,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/money-and-markets/cathie-woods-wild-bets-tesla-and-bitcoin-backfire-can-a-reality-check-help-recover-her-ark.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/104857408.cms', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/94935185.cms', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/47865640.cms', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-644558,msid-107079028/massive-crowd-breaks-cordon-to-see-ram-mandir.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-78187515,quality-100/cross.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74451948,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/42031747.cms', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-19542,msid-107079096/bjp-and-rss-attacking-the-idea-of-india.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-45064,msid-107086880/ram-mandir-cm-shinde-hits-out-at-oppn.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-37656,msid-107083109/5-factors-behind-stock-market-crash-today.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107059939,imgsize-30992,width-138,height-104,quality-100/markets/stocks/news/stock-radar-tech-mahindra-breaks-out-from-consolidation-phase-since-april-2022-time-to-buy.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-37266,msid-107086128/rahul-gandhi-vs-himanta-biswa-sarma-in-assam.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76920425,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-17928,msid-107080216/cannot-be-promoting-one-religion-above-others.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107056486,imgsize-42070,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/technology-and-startups/indian-it-grew-as-it-had-answers-to-problems-today-we-dont-have-that-former-hcl-ceo-vineet-nayar.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-106966924,imgsize-46520,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/technology-and-startups/metaverse-to-meatverse-as-mark-zuckerberg-turns-rancher-investors-have-a-question-wheres-the-beef.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74462387,quality-100/et-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107076238,width-650,height-488,imgsize-214500,resizemode-75/first-look-at-ram-lalla.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-81633715,quality-100/et-prime-logo.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107054000,imgsize-54914,width-138,height-104,quality-100/prime/pharma-and-healthcare/fixing-indias-broken-healthcare-infra-at-the-bottom-ujala-cygnus-is-a-rare-example.jpg', 'https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-107076238,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-214500,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-31438,msid-107081970/elon-musk-on-indias-permanent-seat-at-unsc.jpg', 'https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/thumb/width-152,height-114,resizemode-75,imgsize-573207,msid-107087162/how-ruling-party-uses-interim-budget-ahead-of-polls.jpg'}"
Deepening economic crisis in Nepal - Observer Research Foundation,Deepening economic crisis in Nepal  Observer Research Foundation,2024-01-23 08:45:14,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9yZm9ubGluZS5vcmcvcmVzZWFyY2gvZGVlcGVuaW5nLWVjb25vbWljLWNyaXNpcy1pbi1uZXBhbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-IN&gl=IN&ceid=IN:en,https://www.orfonline.org,Observer Research Foundation,"Even though Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal recently painted a rosy picture of the Nepalese economy based on some positive trends in the hydropower sector, foreign exchange reserve and increased inflow of foreign tourists in the country, the people hardly feel their impact in their day-to-day life. The country is facing a severe economic crisis as agricultural and industrial production is falling, the trade deficit along with the unemployment problem is growing, the stock market is tumbling, the real estate business is sputtering, and restaurants and hotels apart from several other business activities are declining. On top of this, the inflation rate of 8.19 percent is fast eroding the purchasing power of the people.

The agricultural sector, the major driving force of the economy, is in trouble. The country that exported rice has started importing it for some years. In 2021-22, Nepal imported 1.4 million tonnes of rice from India worth US$473.43 million. Later, India imposed a ban on exports of non-basmati white rice to Nepal along with other countries on 20 July 2023, but after some time it allowed Nepal to import 95,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice.

The country is facing a severe economic crisis as agricultural and industrial production is falling, the trade deficit along with the unemployment problem is growing, the stock market is tumbling, the real estate business is sputtering, and restaurants and hotels apart from several other business activities are declining.

Industries are either getting closed or are running far below their capacity. The cement industry, for example, which is one of the prime industries in Nepal is running below 30 percent of its capacity. Of late, the Government of Nepal has given certain incentives to the export industries. It approved a new customs bill that waives customs duty to the export industries on the import of industrial raw materials. This bill also makes provision for tax exemptions on fuel consumed on international flights, aircraft, spare parts, equipment and in-flight food and beverages. It is, however, not known how such provisions would address the problems in the industrial sector.

On account of the lower demand for credits, the profits of the Nepalese commercial banks dropped by 18.61 percent to INR 8.41 billion during the first three months of 2023-24. Several banks have been merged to save them from liquidation. In such a situation, to reassure the general public about the safety of their deposits, Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, has made a provision whereby the banks and financial institutions would have to deposit certain amounts in the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund. Such a step is intended to ensure that in the case of a bank or financial institution facing liquidation, the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund would cover the losses of the depositor up to the amount of INR 312,500.

Furthermore, Nepal’s exports as compared to the imports continue to decline year by year. Between mid-July to mid-December, Nepal exported goods amounting to INR 39.5 billion and imported goods worth INR 401.37 billion, which created a trade deficit of INR 361.87 billion. The exports formed merely 8.96 percent of Nepal’s overall trade.

To reassure the general public about the safety of their deposits, Nepal Rastra Bank, the country's central bank, has made a provision whereby the banks and financial institutions would have to deposit certain amounts in the Deposit and Credit Guarantee Fund.

Besides, the Nepali rupee is gradually losing its value against the US dollar. In the 2022-23 fiscal year, one US dollar was equivalent to NRs. 128 (INR 80.0) on July 17, 2022, which shot up to NRs. 131.68 (IRs. 82.3) on 16 July 2023. Due to this change in the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Nepalese rupees, Nepal incurred a foreign exchange loss worth INR 37.5 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23 as the country had to pay more to foreign creditors in domestic currency.

Over and above, the Nepalese youth, including the women are fleeing from the country in the same way the bees sometimes have to leave their hives when they develop the feeling of insecurity. Over a million young people are fleeing the country each year in search of job opportunities in foreign countries. Many of the youth are even forced to work in foreign countries in areas in which their life is endangered. Recently, of the 200 Nepalese youth who joined the Russian army as mercenaries against the policy of the Nepal government, 7 youths were killed and about 100 are feared missing and injured in their fight with the Ukrainian armies.

The exodus of youth on a large scale to foreign countries has resulted in a decline in the demand for goods and services, like smartphones, restaurants, alcohol, food, and beverages, bikes and other items in the country. This not only eroded the trust of the private sector in the government, but it also negatively affected the investment climate in the country. Observing some of these developments in the Nepalese economy, Chandra Prasad Dhakal, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) said “Nepal’s economy is in a sensitive mode...The shutters of small and medium businesses have been closed. Agricultural products are losing more markets. Demand is shrinking. There is extreme frustration among businessmen and they are planning to escape instead of investing.”

Observing some of these developments in the Nepalese economy, Chandra Prasad Dhakal, President of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI) said “Nepal’s economy is in a sensitive mode...

Recently, the World Bank has projected that Nepal’s economic growth in the current fiscal year is not likely to exceed 3.9 per cent against the government’s target of achieving six per cent economic growth. However, experts believe that the government will not be able to achieve even a 3-percent growth rate this fiscal year because the agricultural sector, the major driver of economic growth, is not responding positively.

Amidst this economic crisis, Nepal is facing the risk of getting greylisted by FATF, the global anti-corruption body. It has found that the country is not so serious about checking money laundering and terrorist financing. Also, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned Nepal about a severe financial crisis if due measures are not taken to improve the economy.

Before it is too late, Nepal needs to restructure its economy on a war footing to ensure that job opportunities are created, domestic production of goods and services is boosted, the trade deficit is reduced, and the purchasing power of people is increased through business promotion. But it is yet to be seen as to how the government amidst the growing political instability in the country can take bold steps in its attempt to revamp the economy.

The PATA Nepal Chapter has been actively dedicated to promoting tourism, both domestically and internationally, in line with the ethos of PATA. This commitment aims to bolster its member organizations and contribute to the sustainable tourism development of Nepal on a broader scale.

Despite challenges leading to the Nepal Tourism Board’s inability to organize international trade fairs this year, the PATA Nepal Chapter has not only secured a consistent space for the Nepal Pavilion but has also successfully upheld the image and visibility of destination Nepal at ITB Berlin, the world’s premier travel hub, taking place from March 5th to March 7th, 2024, in Germany. Moreover, the chapter has played a pivotal role in facilitating the participation of private sector tourism businesses that sought support amidst uncertain circumstances.

In collaboration with 38 Nepali exhibitors, the PATA Nepal Chapter is set to showcase and promote Nepal’s diverse tourism products and offerings at ITB Berlin 2024. A Briefing Session held on January 19th, 2024, at Bricks Cafe, Lalitpur, Nepal, equipped participants with necessary preparatory aspects and updates for the event. This proactive initiative received appreciation from all Nepali exhibitors, who also shared their thoughts and feedback to ensure the success of their participation at ITB 2024.

Looking back at history, the PATA Nepal Chapter, representing the government, spearheaded participation at ITB and WTM from the 1970s to the 1990s before the establishment of NTB. Once again, the chapter has taken a timely initiative to lead destination promotion, ensuring that the private sector remains engaged and motivated.

Following the briefing session, the PATA Nepal Chapter Executive Committee received an invitation from tourism entrepreneurs in Chitwan, a popular wildlife destination in the southern plains of Nepal, for a FAM Trip and Executive Committee Meeting. The trip took place at the newly built Siddhartha Vilasa Banbas, surrounded by lush green and eco-friendly surroundings near Chitwan National Park. The resort aims to revive the allure of Chitwan and offer a rejuvenated wildlife experience for visitors.

During the visit, the Executive Committee explored various properties, including Jungle Safari Lodge, Sapana Village Resort, and Riverbank Jungle Resort. Interactions with local stakeholders focused on tourism prospects and strategies to promote sustainable tourism in the region. To expand its operations nationwide, the committee has decided to establish offices in major tourist locations in all provinces, including Chitwan and Pokhara. A sub-committee has been formed by the PATA Nepal Chapter to draft a concept paper in this regard.

What’s the context? In an effort to turn a risk into a gain, Nepal aims to drain burgeoning glacial lakes and could produce hydropower from the flow

As climate change melts glaciers, floods a growing risk

Efforts to partially drain high mountain lakes underway

Tapping water released could produce clean hydropower LANGTANG, Nepal - High in the Himalayas, two villages near Nepal's border with Tibet are getting power from an unusual source: a threatening glacial lake. In this high-altitude region, climate change is accelerating the melting of mountain ice, with villages located below fast-filling glacial lakes facing a rising risk of catastrophic flooding. But efforts to drain some of the excess water building up in the lakes, to lower surging disaster risk, also present an opportunity to boost clean power production, by installing small hydropower generators in the drainage channels. Since 2017, 175 households in Langtang and Kyanjin, two villages in the high Kyanjin Valley, have been able to tap clean hydropower from efforts to drain the Kyanjin glacial lake for cooking, lights and other energy needs.

""We used to go three hours away from here to collect firewood"" - something hard to find above the tree line, said 48-year-old Pasang Tamang, who runs a hotel in Kyanjin, a popular stopping point for tourists trekking in the mountains. ""Now we have electricity to cook food and boil water,"" she said. The hydropower project, which cost $448,000, was paid for by the Hong Kong-based Kadoorie Charitable Foundation. But expanding such smart solutions - which unusually cut both disaster risk and climate changing emissions - is proving challenging in Nepal with funding limited and work in high-mountain environments challenging and often costly. Power from risk Communities in the Himalayas - and other high mountain regions of the world - face growing risks from fast-filling glacial lakes, which can suddenly burst under pressure and send huge volumes of flash floodwater surging downstream. More than 150 people were killed and 2,000 houses damaged after Lhonak Lake in the northeastern Indian province of Sikkim burst its banks in October last year. Nepal has worked to lower the pressure in several of its most at-risk mountain lakes, including Tsho Rolpa and Imja, using canals to channel some water away. It also has looked at generating power from glacial lake draining since at least 2016, when Dhananjay Regmi, a glacier expert at Tribhuvan University, recognised the possibility while leading work on efforts to reduce lake levels and cut disaster risk near Mount Everest. Working with colleagues, he studied four Nepalese glacial lakes - Thulagi, Lower Barun, Lumding Tsho and Hongu-2 - and produced a study showing hydropower generation was possible as part of drainage efforts. All four lakes were identified in a 2020 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development as having a high risk of bursting their banks. ""There are two benefits to us: first, the risk of outburst will be reduced, and second, we get energy at the same volume throughout the year,"" Regmi told Context. He has focused in particular on Thulagi glacial lake, about 200 km (125 miles) from Kathmandu in Manang district. The 2.5-km-long (1.55-mile) lake is 73 metres (240 ft) deep and holds 36 million cubic metres (1.27 billion cubic feet) of water, according to Regmi's 2017 report - enough to fill more than 14,400 Olympic swimming pools.

If it were to burst, the resulting floods could directly affect 166,000 people downstream and impact many more, with roads, bridges and larger hydropower projects in the region at risk, according to an unpublished analysis by Narendra Khanal, a geography professor at Tribhuvan University. Losses could reach $415 million, the research found, if expected flood levels of 35 metres (114 feet) above the riverbed were reached, requiring replacement of the Marsyangdi and Middle Marsyangdi hydropower dams and putting their revenue at risk. Channelling water out of the lake to hydropower generating equipment, could produce 50 megawatts (MW) of electricity year-round, he said, and lower the lake's water level by five to 10 metres (16.4 to 32.8 feet). ""When the water level is reduced, we don't have to worry about the lake bursting,"" Regmi said. Funding dilemma But finding money for such double-benefit projects and putting them into operation is not easy. Nepal, working with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is seeking $50 million from the Green Climate Fund, with co-financing from the government, UNDP and the private sector, to lower water levels and cut the risk of floods from the Thulagi, Lower Barun, Lumding Tsho and Hongu-2 lakes. But the proposal does not include plans to also generate hydropower. Chiranjeevi Chataut, the director general of Nepal's Department of Energy Development, said making such generation projects work in the high Himalayas is too challenging, one reason the country is not making plans for them. Still, ""if any private sector (applicants) are interested, we can discuss,"" he said. Regmi admitted that working at high altitude could be difficult and costly, but said such generation could be helpful in regularising year-round hydropower supplies. Nepal, for instance, in recent years has generated about 2,800 MW of hydropower nationally each year during the monsoon season, but only a third of that at other times of year, according to the Nepal Electricity Authority. Deepak K.C., a climate change and resilience analyst for UNDP in Nepal, said tapping the country's high-mountain hydropower potential in combination with efforts to cut disaster risk would likely require more joined-up funding. ""Only the private sector can invest in that type of (power) project,"" he said. ""Donor agencies don't invest in generating hydropower."" If the government goes ahead with a lake-lowering project at Thulagi, Regmi's team hopes to find private backing to build a demonstration hydropower project, to show generating clean power at high altitude can work. Installing the project could have other benefits as well, Regmi said. For instance, putting in place a hydropower system would require establishing a cable in the mountains to transport equipment to the site. That could then be turned into a cable car system to attract tourists, or for local transport, he said. ""The project can be done without environmental or ecosystem loss,"" he said.

The proposal seeks Nepal’s input on the tariff for exporting 40 megawatts (MW) of electricity to Bangladesh.

Reports maintained this citing the Kathmandu Post.

NEA Managing Director Kul Man Ghising confirmed the receipt of the draft request, stating, “Bangladesh has sent us a draft request for proposal (RfP), in which we will propose the tariff that we want to levy.”

This move brings the two nations closer to finalising a deal for the import of 40MW of electricity from Nepal.

Upon reaching an agreement on the tariff, a tripartite agreement involving Nepal, Bangladesh, and India is expected to be signed, marking Bangladesh’s inaugural power import from Nepal.","{'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Steering-success-amidst-challenges-Faruque-Hassan’s-transformative-tenure-at-BGMEA-360x203.jpg', 'https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=297235&fmt=gifhttps://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=297235&fmt=gif', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-A-positive-year-for-Bangladesh-RMG-Trade-360x203.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=FeOTq1KAfD20Cs', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/Icons/india-flag.png', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/Icons/vietnam-flag.png', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bangladesh-asks-Nepal-to-outline-tariffs-for-40MW-electricity-export.jpg', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-The-Year-That-Was-360x203.jpg', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/AR_WhiteLogo.png', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/ARlogo.svg', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/Icons/bangladesh-flag.png', 'https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=988163&conversionId=1148251&fmt=gif', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Armana-Group_-Long-term-growth-in-denim-360x203.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=237160480631841&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/themes/appres/images/Icons/global-flag.png', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ap_logo_2.jpg', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Evince-Group-Driving-expansion-and-championing-sustainability-360x203.jpg', 'https://apparelresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Crafting-tomorrows-fashion-Hela-Groups-Digital-Core-paves-the-way-for-swift-sustainable-product-evolution-by-Ruwanthi-Fernando-360x203.jpg'}"

Nestled between two accomplished nations across the South Asian spectrum, China and India, Nepal is in the lap of the Himalayas, and is a country that has an ancient history unlike any other nation in the region. One cannot deem Nepal diminutive, for it has been inscribed in numerous ancient scriptures and Puranas that this land may stand as one of the primordial realms. Through the corridors of antiquity to the present juncture, Nepal harbored myriad prospects to evolve into a triumphant, and opulent nation. Alas, the dominion of autocratic governance, the pervasion of distorted ideologies, and the failure to utilize the available resources have regrettably hindered Nepal from scaling the zenith of prosperity. Nepal has been counted as one of the Asia’s impoverished countries.

Despite having the gift of nature as truly mesmerizing, there have been plenty of issues and evils in the country. Nepalese people have been dealing with a slew of societal issues, including corruption, inflation, high taxes, the country’s deteriorating economic situation, and limited access to health care. Our country’s tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, construction, various industries, supply chain and other service sectors had also been adversely impacted due to Covid-19 pandemic. Due to which the global production and supply chain have been hit hard resulting in great obstacles for economically disadvantaged communities being pushed more into poverty.

David Cameron (United Kingdom, 2016), Silvio Berlusconi (Italy, 2011), Yukio Hatoyama (Japan, 2010) etc. are the instances of visionary leaders with genuine concerns about the country’s progress, who acknowledged the failure of their policies and stepped back promoting heightened intellectual exchange and establishing an environment where discussions emphasize factual evidence rather than personal agendas.

Nepalese people have been unveiling their dissatisfactions and frustrations regarding the various circumstances they have been facing in numerous sectors, according to several surveys and analysis. The instability seen in the economy of the country is all due to the lack of quality in laws and policies prevailing in the territory, the expertise speaks. Our country’s state is said to have been trying to eradicate the frailties of the nation for a very long period, yet no endeavor has truly proven efficacious for Nepal.

According to Observer Research Foundation (ORF), throughout the fiscal year 2022-23, a record-breaking 750,000 youth sought foreign employment. Each day, over 2,000 legally pursue job opportunities in overseas countries. When questioned about their decision to depart for foreign shores in pursuit of better opportunities, the youth articulated that their emigration symbolizes a manifestation of discontentment with the prevailing governance. At the core of Rousseau’s social theory lies the concept of the ‘Social contract’—an agreement between individuals and the government where individuals surrender certain freedoms for protection and communal benefits.

Rousseau contends that the state’s primary role is to serve the people, emphasizing government actions for the collective good. However, in this domain, the state seems to have stumbled from the outset, displaying a lack of accountability and transparency in every facet.

But delving into the status quo in Nepal, the multitude of scandals and controversies undeniably attests to the type of political leadership here. The enduring dominance of the old guards perceived as youth activists by traditional standards, who have consistently secured top positions of authority for an extended period are not mindful that the relentless pursuit of power devoid of a vision for prosperity inevitably paves the way for self-destruction. In the current quandary, as we stand at the crossroads of uncertainty, the pressing question arises: What avenues lie before us? Who, in this labyrinth of concerns, emerges as our true guide? Whose counsel should we heed, and where do we find the authentic answers to the inquiries that trouble the hearts of our nation’s anxious citizens?

In the midst of a prevailing sense of surrender, not only have the younger generation lost hope for brighter days, but even the children, influenced by those who have succumbed to despair, find themselves disheartened. I find myself pondering the future of my homeland with a deep curiosity. I wonder where we can find individuals genuinely concerned about the current situation, who might offer a glimpse of a more positive future. There are moments when I find myself grappling with doubts, particularly concerning my deep affection for the remarkable land I call home. These uncertainties lead me to ponder why I seem unable to align my perspectives with others regarding the challenges our nation confronts.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I wonder why I can’t see eye to eye with others on the issues our nation is facing. It’s a source of reflection, sparking inquiries about my ability to make a meaningful impact, especially when standing alone in a crowd of individuals who exude an air of arrogance. Despite these uncertainties, a resilient curiosity lingers within me, compelling me to explore the potential for change, even in the face of daunting odds. In the quiet corners of my contemplation, I find myself surrounded with questions that echo in the corridors of my thoughts. Are there any citizens left who share my concerns, refusing to accept the status quo and fiercely ready to face the challenges. Or do we find ourselves surrounded by the silent echoes of martyrs; their souls now seemingly crying helplessly? On the contrasting side, figures like Prem Aacharya, even in death, linger in our collective memory, serving as poignant reminders of our nation’s struggle.

Or do we find ourselves surrounded by the silent echoes of martyrs; their souls now seemingly crying helplessly? On the contrasting side, figures like Prem Aacharya, even in death, linger in our collective memory, serving as poignant reminders of our nation’s struggle.

So, what now, what steps can be taken to safeguard countless individuals like Aacharya? How can we shield our people from being exploited in several ways in distant lands every passing moment, far from their cherished motherland? The key, it seems, is within our reach, embedded in our thoughts and shared vision. We can show it by doing it, but only with collective action, with unity. Regardless of our identities or personal interests, if we approach our tasks with sincerity and honesty, we hold the power to effect positive change in this situation. Imagine a scenario where everyone in our society, be it farmers, industrial leaders, or the president, passionately and honestly performing their respective roles.

In such a situation, it’s worth pondering: what could impede our journey toward prosperity? It’s an idea worth reflecting on, considering how each person’s dedication and integrity could collectively propel us towards a more prosperous future. Giving up means losing confidence in our future endeavors. Instead of quitting, let’s view our challenges as opportunities to reshape our future the way we want it to be. Imagine a path where we control everything, bringing happiness and satisfaction not just for ourselves but for the younger ones too. Let’s not give up; let’s don’t leave things unfinished. Remember, every ending can be a happy one, and if it’s not happy, it’s not the end, there’s more to add in history!

Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Nepal. [Photo provided to China Daily]

Zhang Wei is proud to have helped put together the 13th Chinese medical team that conducted minimally invasive surgeries at a cancer hospital in Nepal, contributing to the advancement of the country's healthcare services.

Zhang, who led the team of 17 medical professionals and is also head of the Urology Department at the Baoding-based Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University, specializes in minimally invasive surgeries on urological tumors.

Such surgeries are preferred over general operations because they cause less trauma to the body and less postoperative pain for the patient. In addition, patients can recover more quickly.

During their mission from September 2020 to June 2022 at the B.P. Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in central-southern Nepal, Zhang and his team not only saved some local patients' lives, but also introduced advanced medical techniques and traditional Chinese medicine to Nepal.

The hospital was built with a grant from the Chinese government in December 1998. China began sending medical teams the following year.

""Despite being Nepal's most comprehensive cancer hospital, minimally invasive surgeries were not being conducted often enough due to inadequate equipment and limited awareness,"" Zhang said, adding that his primary focus at the hospital was on developing minimally invasive laparoscopic surgeries.

According to Zhang, based on the efforts of previous Chinese medical teams, he and his team, successfully performed multiple complex laparoscopic surgeries during their 21-month stay.

Among them was the successful removal of a massive pheochromocytoma (a type of tumor) through retroperitoneal laparoscopy－a high-risk procedure.

""The patient had been refused admission by several hospitals in Nepal due to the high risk of the surgery and its high degree of difficulty,"" Zhang said.

Upon learning of the Chinese medical team's presence, the patient traveled over four hours to reach the hospital.","{'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/facebook.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/share.png', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b055f7a3105f211c860325.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2016/sub/a-2.jpg', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/showDesktop.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2017/more_art.gif', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b047cda3105f211c8602b5.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2016/sub/a-3.jpg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2016/sub/a-4.jpg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2017/logo.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/linkedin.png', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b04041a3105f211c86018b.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/twitter.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2016/sub/a-1.jpg', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b044f9a3105f211c860214.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/linkedin.png', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/mEnglish.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/weibo.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/facebook.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2017/logo.gif', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/mChinese.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/timg.jpg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2017/app.gif', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/23/65af7c92a3105f211c85fd5a.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/share/mail.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/weibo.jpg', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b06d01a3105f211c8605f6.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2017/cnbut.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/twitter.png', 'http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b06d01a3105f211c860602.jpeg', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/static/common/img/showmobilee.png', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/weixin.jpg', 'https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202401/24/65b0451da3105f211c860223.jpeg', 'https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/image_e/2020/logo_chinadaily.jpg'}"
