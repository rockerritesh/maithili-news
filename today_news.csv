Anti-Rabies Vaccine Shortage Hits Bheri Hospital Patients

Bheri Hospital in Nepalgunj, Banke District, is facing a severe shortage of anti-rabies vaccines, forcing patients to purchase expensive doses from private pharmacies.

Despite the hospital receiving over 200 patients daily for dog bites, the supply of doses has not kept pace with the high demand.

Minister Warns ‘Climate Change Impacts Women’

During a recent address, she noted that events like glacial lake outbursts and irregular snowfall disproportionately affect women who depend on informal income from homestays and local handicrafts. Minister Shrestha criticized “gender-blind climate financing,” arguing that most resilient funds focus only on physical infrastructure rather than social security for women workers. She emphasized that as men migrate for work due to climate disasters, women face a “triple burden” of managing households, farming, and community disaster response. She called for direct investment in female-led enterprises and climate-resilient cooperative structures.

Bara RSP Candidate Resigns, Citing Financial Irregularities in Party

Pawan Chaudhary, a founding member and organization chief of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) in Bara District of Madhesh Province, resigned from his post and general membership on Friday.

Police Intensify Checks Against Smuggling at Rasuwagadhi Border

The Nepal Police at the Rasuwagadhi border have urged traders and drivers to follow legal customs procedures amid rising cases of revenue evasion.

After constructive discussions, Ms. Jahan issued the following statement at the end of the mission:

""The Nepali authorities and IMF staff conducted discussions for the 2026 Article IV consultation and reached staff-level agreement on the policies and reforms needed to complete the seventh review under the ECF (see Press Release No. 22/6 ). [2] The agreement is subject to approval by the IMF's Executive Board. Upon completion of the Executive Board Review Nepal would have access to SDR 31.32 million (about US$ 43.2 million), bringing the total IMF financial support disbursed under the ECF to SDR 282.42 million (about US$ 384.4 million).

""Despite a challenging domestic environment, Nepal continues to make progress with the implementation of the ECF-supported program. Program performance has been satisfactory, with all quantitative performance targets for mid‑July 2025 met except for the indicative target on child welfare grants, which was missed marginally. Notable reforms that have been completed as part of the seventh review include adoption of a Customs Compliance Improvement Strategy, completion of the onsite inspection as part of the Loan Portfolio Review (LPR), and realignment of the asset classification regulations with Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) Guidelines. Agreement was reached on the draft Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Act amendments to incorporate key recommendations from the IMF's 2021 Safeguard Assessment and 2023 Financial Sector Stability Report. Submission of the NRB Act amendments to Parliament is a critical component of the reforms under the program.

""Protest-related damages and economic uncertainty have weighed on economic activity and private sector confidence, delaying investment decisions. Growth in FY2025/26 is projected at 3 to 3.5 percent, well below potential. Inflation remained low—at 2.4 percent y/y in January 2026—reflecting in part due to subdued demand. Fiscal revenue growth remained modest and mid-year budget revised projections for capital expenditure. The external position continued to strengthen, with buoyant remittances, resilient tourism receipts, and subdued import growth. International reserves increased further and remain comfortably above adequacy levels.

""Financial sector vulnerabilities have intensified further, with non‑performing loans (NPLs) of the financial sector rising to 5.4 percent in January 2026 and are expected to be revised higher based on the recently completed LPR, impacting banks' capital. The LPR will likely provide recommendations for further strengthening bank balance sheets and enhancing the NRB's regulatory and supervisory approach to more accurately assess bank asset quality. The financial health of the savings and credit cooperatives (SACCOs) remains challenging.

""Looking ahead, a peaceful political transition is expected to restore business confidence, support pick-up in investment and consumption, and accelerate the recovery in domestic demand. Inflation is expected to remain within the NRB's policy target ceiling. However, the outlook is subject to important downside risks, including political uncertainty, under-execution of capital projects, an increase in financial sector vulnerabilities and remittance slowdown.

""Against this background, reform momentum should continue to preserve macroeconomic stability and strengthen Nepal's policymaking framework. Further efforts to mobilize domestic revenues would support development spending, while efforts to boost public investment and improve spending efficiency would enhance medium-term growth. The current accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate, and the NRB should continue to strengthen its monetary policy toolkit to enhance liquidity management.

""Rising financial sector vulnerabilities warrant increased vigilance and the design of a comprehensive strategy to improve bank NPL recoveries. Addressing any deficiencies in loan classification and provision that are highlighted in the LPR report will be critical to more accurately reflect asset weaknesses on bank balance sheets and ensure that banks are well provisioned and capitalized, essential to underpinning financial stability. Amendments to the NRB Act would strengthen the central bank's independence and governance and make the bank resolution regime more robust. The planned creation of an Asset Management Company must incorporate international best practices. Achieving concrete results in implementation of the anti-money laundering framework is key to expediting Nepal's exit from the FATF grey list.

""Good governance and strong institutions are central to boost private investment, improve productivity, create quality jobs, reduce inequality, and foster inclusive and durable growth. The authorities' plan to formulate a blueprint on improving governance and delivery of service is welcome, as is their commitment to the IMF's TA on Governance and Corruption Diagnostics.

""The IMF team held meetings with the Honorable Finance Minister Mr. Rameshore Prasad Khanal, the National Planning Commission Vice-Chairman Honorable Dr. Prakash Kumar Shrestha, the Nepal Rastra Bank Governor Dr. Biswo Nath Poudel, and other senior government and central bank officials. The IMF team also met with representatives from the private sector, think tank, and development partners.

""The IMF team is grateful to the Nepali authorities for their hospitality and for open and constructive discussions.""

According to the Department of Customs, this represents a 15.76% increase compared to the same period last year. Imports rose by 13.65% to Rs 11.234 billion, while exports saw a significant 32.19% growth, reaching Rs 1.681 billion. Officials noted that trade activity spiked in January, likely driven by the upcoming House of Representatives elections. Despite the overall growth, the trade deficit increased by 10.91% to Rs 9.553 billion.

Export Growth Improves Country’s Import-Export Ratio

Significant growth in exports has improved the country’s trade balance ratio during the first seven months of the current fiscal year. While the country imported Rs 7.77 worth of goods for every Rs 1 exported last year, that ratio has now dropped to 6.68. The export share in total trade increased from 11.40% to 13.02%, while the import share decreased slightly to 86.98%. The Department of Customs reported that exports reached Rs 168.145 billion by mid-February, a sharp rise from Rs 127.204 billion in the previous year. This shift indicates a positive trend in domestic production and international trade.

India followed as the second-largest supplier with 1,263 units worth Rs 2.65 billion, while Thailand supplied 401 units.

Political Parties Prioritize Energy in Election Manifestos

Major political parties have placed the energy sector at the center of their election manifestos, viewing it as the primary driver for economic prosperity. The Nepali Congress aims to reach 14,000 megawatts of capacity and 750 units of per capita consumption within five years. Meanwhile, the CPN (UML) plans to develop Nepal as a clean energy hub for South Asia, doubling current consumption levels. Other parties, including the CPN (Maoist Centre) and Rastriya Swatantra Party, have set ambitious long-term goals of up to 40,000 megawatts by 2100. Common themes across manifestos include policy reform, cross-border energy diplomacy, and encouraging private investment.

Other notable investors include Life Insurance Corporation with Rs 3.116 billion and IME Life with Rs 2.562 billion. Experts suggest that companies are moving away from traditional fixed deposits as banks remain hesitant to accept large institutional deposits at competitive rates. MetLife Insurance remains the only firm with zero investment in listed shares.

Health Minister Promises Funds for KAHS Infrastructure

During a visit to Jumla on February 12, Health Minister Dr Sudha Sharma Gautam assured that budget shortages would not halt the development of the Karnali Academy of Health Sciences (KAHS). She pledged to prioritize the stalled Rs 6 billion infrastructure project in the upcoming budget and request the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure to build a 6-kilometer access road to Chere Chaur. However, officials remain skeptical, noting that previous ministerial promises went unfulfilled. The academy currently hosts over 500 staff and students across 12 educational programs, including MBBS and MD, all struggling with a severe lack of residential and academic space.

Labor Ministry Issues Procedures for Workplace-Based Training

The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has issued new procedures for workplace-based training to bridge the skill gap in the domestic labor market. Under the National Vocational Training Institute Development Committee Order 2024, basic training will range from 390 to 730 hours. The policy mandates that employers provide guaranteed employment following training; for instance, a one-month training requires a two-month job commitment. The Institute will cover minimum wages and Social Security Fund contributions during the training period. This initiative aims to supply skilled manpower to industries while ensuring stable employment opportunities for the Nepali workforce.

Rs 6 Billion Infrastructure Project at KAHS Remains Stalled

A multi-year master plan to build 26 faculty buildings for the Karnali Academy of Health Sciences remains stalled due to a lack of funding. Although a detailed project report for the Rs 6.29 billion project at Chere Chaur Chandannath municipality of the Jumla district was prepared nine years ago, only one basic science building and an administrative block have been completed for Rs 760 million. The academy, which serves 13 districts including those in Sudurpashchim, is currently forced to conduct classes in rented houses. Registrar Laxmi Chandra Mahat noted that while local donors provided 254366.41 square meters of land, successive governments have failed to prioritize the necessary budget for this health tourism hub.

Budget Secured for Rara Lake Access Road

The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has secured a budget of Rs 910 million to blacktop the 15-kilometer road section from Baluwa Khola to Diyaragaun. This route serves as the primary gateway to Rara Lake, a premier tourist destination in Mugu. Shrawan Kumar Mahatara, Chief of Road Division Jumla, credited the funding to the initiatives of Infrastructure Minister Madhav Chaulagain and former lawmaker Gyanendra Bahadur Shahi. Despite operating since the fiscal year 2012/13, the 93-kilometer Nagma-Gamgadhi road remained largely unpaved. This new multi-year project aims to facilitate tourism and economic development by replacing muddy and dusty tracks with high-quality asphalt.

Maldhunga-Beni Road Upgrade Completed

The 13-kilometer Maldhunga-Beni road, connecting Myagdi and Mustang to the national highway, has been upgraded to a two-lane asphalt road. Part of the Kaligandaki Corridor project, the Rs 528.6 million contract with Apex-Khadka-Krishna JV resulted in an 11-meter-wide road. Project Chief Tejaswi Sharma confirmed that most sections are complete, excluding small portions in Waribeni and landslide-prone areas. The upgrade has significantly reduced the travel time between Maldhunga and Beni from one hour to just 15 to 20 minutes. This improvement is expected to ease the journey for thousands of pilgrims and tourists traveling to the Muktinath temple.

Nepalgunj Customs Collects Over Rs 11 Billion Revenue

The Nepalgunj Customs Office, Banke District, collected Rs 11.046 billion in revenue during the first seven months of the current fiscal year 2025/26. Office Chief Janardan Paudel noted that while collection increased by Rs 92.4 million compared to the same period last year, the office has only reached 45% of its annual target of Rs 24.545 billion. Monthly targets were missed throughout the period, with collection rates ranging from 69% to 88%. Despite the operation of the Integrated Check Post at the Jamunaha border, a high trade deficit remains a significant concern.

Mustang Tourist Arrivals Reach 325K in Seven Months

A total of 325,558 tourists visited Mustang during the first seven months of the current fiscal year. According to Inspector Nawaraj Neupane, this includes 69,814 foreign and 252,664 domestic visitors. While numbers remain high, there is a 5.33% decrease compared to the same period last year. Most visitors entered via the Beni-Jomsom road, with mid-October and mid-November recording the highest traffic of 83,766 and 75,599, respectively. The data shows that while most Indian tourists visit for Muktinath darshan, approximately 3% of foreign tourists explore Upper Mustang. Improved road connectivity continues to be the primary driver for the district’s tourism.

Sauraha Hotel Occupancy Drops to 50% in Peak Season

Hotel occupancy in Sauraha, Chitwan District, a major tourist hub, has fallen to 50% during the peak months of February, March, and April. Historically, hotels in the region remained 80% full during this period, which is ideal for wildlife sightings in Chitwan National Park. Om Prakash Pandey, President of the Regional Hotel Association Chitwan, expressed concern over the unexpected decline in foreign arrivals. Business owners believe the upcoming election on March 5 has deterred international travelers. Currently, 148 hotels in Sauraha provide direct employment to 6,400 people, but the lack of tourists is severely impacting local livelihoods and related businesses like elephant safaris.

Business networking, B2B, and B2G meetings will bring together policymakers, ministers, diplomats, industrialists, investors and entrepreneurs to explore new opportunities for shared growth and sustainable regional development.

Alongside policy and commerce, the festival showcases Nepal's cultural heritage through musical performances, film screenings, including the documentary 'Gurkha Warriors' on day one, traditional arts and authentic Nepali cuisine.

Speaking at a press conference at the Press Club of India on Tuesday, ECCI President Yubaraj Baral described the event as a “transformative platform”.

“The festival will further support the expansion of investment opportunities, foster meaningful partnerships across various sectors between Nepal and India, and deepen the historic friendship between the two nations,” Mr Baral said. “This landmark bilateral event will further reinforce India-Nepal economic diplomacy and promote long-term regional cooperation.”

Organisers say the initiative addresses the need to expand trade and reduce imbalances, while promoting people-to-people contacts rooted in shared history, open borders and cultural affinities. The three-day event is expected to serve as a key platform for advancing bilateral economic diplomacy amid ongoing efforts to strengthen connectivity and mutual prosperity.

The Tibetan medicine doctor wrapped his fingers around my wrist, closed his eyes and felt my pulse. The small, dark room was silent except for the faint hiss of a single candle. Its shelves were lined with glass jars of dried roots, bark and powders, each labelled in Tibetan script. Within minutes, the amchi, an 11th-generation Tibetan medicine practitioner named Tsewang Gyurme Gurung, began to speak. “You have a problem with your right shoulder,” he said in English, his fingers still resting lightly on my wrist. “There is a restlessness in your mind; your thoughts jump.” Then, almost casually, “And you have struggled with a fertility issue for a long time.” I nodded slowly, aware of how improbable it would have seemed anywhere else – and how entirely plausible it felt here, in the barren highlands of Nepal’s Mustang region – that all of this could be deduced from my pulse. Amchis are trained in Sowa Rigpa, a centuries-old Tibetan medical system practised across the Himalayas that sees the body as inseparable from the mind, environment and spirit. In remote regions like this, one of the most intact Tibetan cultural landscapes outside Tibet, they remain central figures. As the keepers of ancestral medical knowledge, practitioners like Gurung treat imbalance as much as illness. The one-page prescription I left his room with included everything from a herbal remedy to a mantra I must recite daily. His accuracy rattled me. Then again, becoming a bit discombobulated was part of why I’d wanted to travel to Mustang for my 40th birthday in the first place. I’d reached this age without a child, largely by choice. My husband and I were trying to inhabit the life that decision had made possible. Celebrating the day in a remote Himalayan region that we’d dreamt of visiting for almost a decade felt like a kind of promise to ourselves: that we would keep shaping life on our own terms. Shinta Mani Mustang was also part of the draw. From the moment we arrived at the 29-suite lodge the previous day, set in the village of Jomsom in Lower Mustang, it was clear this was a place in which to mark milestones. Two tall, wooden gates painted with the “endless knot”, a Buddhist symbol of infinite wisdom and compassion, swung open to greet us, revealing a central courtyard lined with poplar trees. The U-shaped, two-storey lodge rose up around it, built from local stone and timber, drawing on Mustang’s traditional Thakali architecture. After being shown to our suite by our personal butler, we spent our first hour doing little beyond taking in the details. The view from a room in the Shinta Mani Mustang lodge. Elise Hassey

Tibetan tiger rugs, a traditional symbol of protection, lay underfoot. A white, yak-tail chamara, a ritual whisk used in shamanic and Buddhist rituals, hung from the door. An orange, cashmere blanket, hand-embroidered with details of the region’s famous blue sheep, lay on the bed. Even the bathroom curtains were meaningful, printed with the “auspicious cloud”, a Tibetan symbol of interconnectedness. The design, a collaboration between Nepali hotelier Namgyal Sherpa and renowned hotel architect Bill Bensley, managed to feel simultaneously theatrical and deeply rooted in place. It took a concerted effort to leave our room at all. Eventually, though, we were lured downstairs by the spa. We slipped into the large hot pool, set in front of floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the snow-capped peaks of the Nilgiri range. Rotating between the pool, sauna and steam room while waiting for my massage, I wondered whether this sort of pampering might need to feature more heavily in my 40s, as a form of preventative healthcare.

Next morning, after a breakfast that felt more ritual than meal – juices, fruit and granola, fresh muffins and crispy potato parathas, served with wide mountain views on the terrace – we headed off. Striding out along the mountain pathways, we passed craggy cliff faces of unfathomable scale reaching into the hard blue sky, as vultures circled above. Many of the cliffs had “sky caves” bored into them. Our guide told us these had served as burial sites, meditation chambers and monasteries since Neolithic times. After crossing a hair-raising suspension bridge one hour later, we reached Lubra. The 800-year-old village was home to a huddle of whitewashed mud houses, the doorways marked with talismans made of goat skulls, painted motifs and scraps of prayer flags. These “ghost trappers”, or keni, were protective markers intended to trap wandering spirits before they entered the house, said our guide. They seemed like a sensible precaution in a place this ancient, where the past mingles so freely with the present. In the 800-year-old village of Lubra, locals practise Bon, a spiritual tradition that predates Buddhism. Elise Hassey

Lubra is one of the last remaining villages in the world practising Bon, a spiritual tradition predating Buddhism. After lunch on the rooftop of a local home, a simple thali of dal, curried vegetables, pickles and tsampa (roasted barley flour shaped into balls), we set off towards a cave monastery above the village. Inside the ochre-washed structure were elaborate thangka, paintings of Buddhist deities and teachings. Butter lamps flickered and, in the far corner, there was a natural rock cavity, used by early practitioners for long retreats. I sat briefly in the cave’s darkness, trying to absorb what the place was offering, before stepping back out into the high Mustang sun. That afternoon, following a second round of spa treatments, came our consultations with the in-house amchi. My husband went into the same small room after me and emerged looking pale and a little unmoored. Later, over a four-course dinner in the lodge’s Nilgiri restaurant, he told me that, after feeling his pulse, the amchi immediately sensed the acute burnout he’d been experiencing over the past year. He said its source wasn’t what my husband thought it was (work), but unprocessed grief from eight years ago. “When Mum died,” he said. We sat with that for a while, eating our Tibetan momo dumplings, unsure what to make of it. When we tried to describe what had happened in that room, language kept slipping away. Diagnosis felt too clinical. Intuition too vague. Pattern-reading, coincidence, none of it quite fit. Whatever had taken place resisted neat explanation. And perhaps that was the point. Editor's pick Good Weekend Some people walk to get fitter, more creative or be in nature. This is why I do it The thought followed me into my birthday. After two nights of shallow sleep at altitude, I woke before dawn, the day already feeling faintly dreamlike. I sat soaking in the bath, steam smudging the mountains beyond the window, my notebook perched on the rim. I wrote, almost feverishly, about what might loosen if I stopped trying so hard to make my life make sense. For years, I’d carried the conviction that a life without certain markers needed extra explanation, even to myself. That I should be able to defend it, to smooth its edges somehow. Watching the sun slip a blazing white cap over the mountains, I felt something in me let go. I didn’t need to explain my life. I only needed to live it – without apology. The rest of the day became a study in unapologetic indulgence. A private lunch for two on a 500-year-old monastery rooftop, the table laid with wildflowers and bowls of handmade ravioli, the mountains unfurling in every direction. At Muktinath, one of the world’s highest pilgrimage sites, we cleansed our sins beneath 108 icy water spouts shaped like small, brass cow heads.

The ever-opaque China Tibet Mountaineering Association (CTMA) has neither confirmed nor denied whether Everest North Side will close. Nor has Chinese media said anything. However, sources at The Tourism Times have told ExplorersWeb that they are certain about the closure.

We consulted four expedition operators with climbs planned for Everest North Side this spring. One of them insisted they had heard nothing from the CTMA.

“They are saying we have to wait,” said the operator, who also wondered whether economic interests in Nepal might prompt unfounded rumors. However, another outfitter believes the Chinese side of Everest will likely be closed to foreigners this year. To avoid such uncertainty and prevent their clients’ potential disappointment, they have decided to operate solely on the mountain’s South, or Nepal, Side.

In recent years, uncertainty has surrounded the North Side of Everest before every season. The North Side has been closed for five of the last 10 years, including during COVID.

Tibet’s closure, Nepal’s win

A closure of the North Side of Everest is, of course, good news for Nepal, as Nepalese tourism would inherit most of the climbers booked for Tibet. The Tourism Times article also notes that there have been “misunderstandings” about the potential new regulations for Everest. Some climbers have inquired if they need to summit a 7,000m peak in Nepal first. However, as an ExplorersWeb story about this recently explained, this Tourism Bill is still months away from approval and will not be applied before 2027 at the earliest.

The main change for Everest climbers this year is that permit fees have risen from $11,000 to $15,000. Note that Nepal doesn’t limit the number of Everest permits, while China caps it at around 300.

The fireworks faux-pas

Usually, the CTMA cites safety reasons for closing Tibetan peaks to foreign expeditions. That was their official position during the COVID pandemic, and in the fall of 2023, after an avalanche killed two American women and their Nepalese guides on Shisha Pangma. It led to the mountain’s early closure that season.

However, the “controversial fireworks” mentioned in the article makes little sense as a reason. That event took place months ago, and it didn’t happen on Everest, but on the outskirts of Shigatse, a city southwest of Lhasa. Here’s the story.

Last September, the outdoor gear brand Arc’teryx sponsored a performance by Chinese pyrotechnics artist Cai Guo-Qiang on the outskirts of that Tibetan city. Three sets of fireworks went off along a mountain ridge, creating the allegory of a “rising dragon.” The event precipitated criticism and an investigation by Chinese authorities.

Although organizers stated that the fireworks were eco-friendly and biodegradable, and they cleaned up the site afterwards, critics argued that the noise and smoke harmed the fragile ecosystem.

“Critics also denounced the performance as an act of cultural arrogance, noting that local traditions include reverence for mountain deities and taboos against loud explosions,” Global Times reported.

Issue settled

The backlash spread internationally. The organizers deleted the videos of the event, and Arc’teryx issued an apology, according to CNN. Four local officials lost their jobs after the Chinese investigation, and Arc’teryx and Cai were ordered to pay to “restore the environment,” according to the BBC.

The 52-second event took place on a grassy hill at nearly 5,000m, far from Everest Base Camp. Some weeks later, a large American team came to Everest with no problem, including a film crew led by Jimmy Chin and skier Jim Morrison, who skied down the Hornbein Couloir.

It is hard to see how this fireworks event relates to a possible Everest closure this spring. However, as we’ve often seen, Chinese authorities need no particular reason to ban foreigners from their side of Everest.","{'https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KbMJ-y4beb5AJ.gif', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10162354/oleg-people-300x300.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/24004742/IMG-20190225-WA0010-300x300.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=3399673563680433&ev=PageView&noscript=1', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_1489473716-e1769459322342-300x236.jpg', 'https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=31601662&cv=3.6.0&cj=1', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jost-wie-06-300x183.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tyler-01-300x200.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-10-28-170409-1536x876-1.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/everest-BC-lakpa-8k-700x407.jpg', 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11161645/fa_everestn2018_10-960x675-1.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_4629-300x170.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/everst-north-700x348.jpg', 'https://explorersweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/tyler-01-300x184.jpg'}","नेपाल केरऽ द टूरिज्म टाइम्स म॑ आय एगो लेख म॑ कहलऽ गेलऽ छै कि आरू भी अधिक पर्वतारोही एवरेस्ट केरऽ नेपाली तरफ जाय वाला छै “चीन न॑ वसंत ऋतु लेली तिब्बती मार्ग (नॉर्थ कर्नल) क॑ बंद करै के खबर के बाद, आर्क’टेरिक्स आरू [आतिशबाजी कलाकार] कै गुओ-कियांग द्वारा संयुक्त रूप स॑ संचालित एगो विवादित आतिशबाजी शो के बाद।”

Export of soybean oil almost doubled during the review period as compared to the corresponding period last fiscal year.

Soybean oil worth Rs. 66.79 was exported during the first seven months of the current fiscal year, while soybean oil worth Rs. 32.41 billion was exported during the first seven months of the last fiscal year.

Similarly, palm oil worth Rs. 3.77 billion was exported in the first seven months of the current fiscal year. That figure for the same period last fiscal year was Rs. 1.38 billion.

The export of sunflower oil also decreased to Rs. 5.7 billion during the review period from Rs. 6.57 billion during the same period last fiscal.

During the review period, tea and coffee worth Rs. 2.60 billion and cardamom worth Rs. 8.6 billion were exported.

Imports rise by 13.65 per cent

During the review period, imports increased by 13.65 per cent. Goods worth Rs. 1,123.48 billion were imported, compared to Rs. 988.58 billion during the same period last fiscal year.

Over the seven months, Nepal imported petroleum products worth Rs. 151.80 billion.

According to the statistics, the country imported petrol worth Rs. 38.13 billion, diesel worth Rs. 69.91 billion, aviation fuel worth Rs. 11.51 billion, kerosene worth Rs. 402 million and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) worth Rs. 31.85 billion during the review period.

Additionally, crude sunflower worth Rs. 70.99 billion, crude palm oil worth Rs. 6.92 billion, and sunflower oil worth Rs. 9.92 billion were imported during the review period.

The country spent Rs. 35.62 billion for the import of cereals, including paddy and rice (Rs. 25.48 billion), wheat (Rs. 1.20 billion), maize (Rs. 8.30 billion), and millet (Rs. 429 million) during the review period.

Despite the sharp increase in exports, Nepal’s trade deficit continued to widen during the first seven months of the current fiscal year.

The country’s trade deficit rose by 10.91 per cent to Rs. 955.34 billion by mid-February 2026.

During the same period of the previous fiscal year 2024/25, the trade deficit stood at Rs. 861.38 billion.","{'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96777/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96784/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/885/conversions/square-thumb-thumb-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96780/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96788/conversions/EC-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96784/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96782/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96778/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/commons/rising-logo.png', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96774/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96777/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96781/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96779/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96781/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96780/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96770/Untitled-1.jpg'}","एक स्टाफ रिपोर्टर,काठमांडू, 21 फरवरी : निर्यात मँ तेज उछाल आरू आयात मँ लगातार वृद्धि के कारण चालू वित्तीय वर्ष २०२५/२६ केरौ पहिलौ सात महीना मँ नेपाल केरौ विदेश व्यापार मँ काफी विस्तार दर्ज करलौ गेलौ छै ।

The Olympiad brought together 70 of the nation’s most competent students for a three-day national competition held from February 18 to 20.

NEO aims to bridge the gap between high school and university-level education by elevating curricula in finance, business, and economics. It also promotes research-oriented tendencies among students through competitions, events, workshops, and sessions, providing mentorship for economics enthusiasts.

Selected from an initial pool of 2,000 participants representing 200 high schools across Nepal, 70 students underwent 1.5 months of rigorous training and mentorship, allowing them to explore economics, business, and personal finance, including financial literacy, decision-making, and saving.

The finale of the National Economics Olympiad consisted of three constructive phases: training in logical reasoning and critical analysis, tackling policy cases using economic theories and ideas, and final presentations.

The Olympiad tested the students’ analytical depth through complex finance MCQs and policy essays. “It is a competition of ideas,” said Arjun Sapkota, president of Nepal Economics Olympiad. “This encourages the participants to expand their horizons of critical and logical understanding,” he added.

“Being a topper is not everything. People have their own ways of learning and achieving excellence in their fields. This platform helped us unfold what we are capable of in our own individual ways,” said Aaditya Yadav, a participant.

Encountering like-minded peers, students were introduced to educational approaches beyond conventional classroom methods. Pawan Chaudhary, a student at New Horizon English Boarding School in Butwal, reflected on how the experience helped him understand privilege through moments shared with the cohort and the encouragement he received from friends and teachers.

“I came here with a laptop lent by a friend. Financial limitations did not become a barrier because of their support and encouragement,” he said.

Reshika Malla, a student at Motherland Secondary School in Pokhara, has envisioned a career in economics after participating in the Olympiad. “Initially, I turned down economics, given my declining marks and understanding of the subject’s intensity. However, the competition’s approaches to provide practical knowledge encouraged me to explore the subject more,” she said.

This year’s winners, along with the gold medalists—Aarya Sharma, Kanav Baid, Samriddha Bhattarai, Nischal Ghimire and Aaditya Rauniyar—will represent Nepal at the International Economics Olympiad in Australasian Economics Olympiad in Sydney, Australia (July 2 to 6) and Suzhou, China (July 12 to 20).

Beyond global exposure, participants compete for prestigious university scholarships and engage with distinguished leaders.","{'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logos/thekathmandupost-logo.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/tkp-logo-weekender.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logos/thekathmandupost-logo-white.png', 'https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2026/third-party/15-1771637905.jpg', 'https://openweathermap.org/img/w/01d.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logo-sticky-bar-tkp-weekender-1.png'}","सप्तम नेपाल अर्थशास्त्र ओलम्पियाड २०२६ ललितपुरके काठमाण्डौ प्रबन्ध महाविद्यालयमे शुक्रदिन आधिकारिक समापन भेल अछि । ओलंपियाड म॑ राष्ट्र केरऽ ७० सबसें सक्षम छात्रऽ क॑ एक साथ लानलऽ गेलै आरू १८ स॑ २० फरवरी तलक आयोजित तीन दिन के राष्ट्रीय प्रतियोगिता करलऽ गेलै ।

Growing Tension Between Old And New Forces - The Rising Nepal,Growing Tension Between Old And New Forces  The Rising Nepal,2026-02-21 02:40:04,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUEFVX3lxTE92VEpwN1VFSXVvcTg4aTlwTmxNM1JNU2p1cUtRMGZlT3BpcW5tQkpBVVpsTDRXSThvZllTRDJIWU1WX1lhazVHWmg2Rjg0U2NO?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://risingnepaldaily.com,The Rising Nepal,"An open polity is open to the flow of change. It is receptive to internal and external stimuli and adjusts to their pressures to keep its stability unharmed. One condition for political stability is the ability of the polity to fairly balance inputs and outputs. It is vital to control entropy and enhance resilience. Each major political movement of Nepal has stoked the democratic aspiration of Nepalis for freedom, justice and a better life. It resulted in the change of the existing constitution and government, ended in a compromise and accommodated the aspiring elites into governmental power. But in no way was it revolutionary to break ties with the old political classes, shape a new political culture and improve people’s life-prospects.

Noteworthy tension exists in Nepal between the old and new political classes; the latter’s technological efficacy amounts to some discontinuities in cognition, values and attitudes. The change in demographics, education, finance, technology and leadership is creating ripe conditions for the change of Nepali politics. Modernisation of agriculture, business, urbanisation, rationality of administration, media and mass political awareness for political participation have evolved preconditions for improving the legitimacy of politics and its adjustment to change. The literature of dissent of the intellectual community has often flashed voices as a critique of the political order so that the regime does not sink into sectarian lines but remains receptive to responsiveness, inclusion and representation of the nation’s social diversity.

Balance

The unsettling of these factors has left the political condition often troubling, requiring an anchor for a balance between continuity and change. Three elements make political conditions for change in Nepali politics. First, steady dislocation of old parties and the shifting pattern of loyalties of the people driven more by information and communication than history, culture, tradition and ideology. Migration, education, communication, occupational shifts, commercialisation and social mobility added new elements into the change process. Second, Western education, ideologies, business practices, admin, management and associational movements have undervalued the indigenous knowledge and tradition, deeming the latter unscientific and less useful for teaching, inquiry, policy formulation and social change.

Third, global pressure to adopt many norms and resolutions has made Nepal amenable to new political acculturation of youths. Real change in Nepal, however, does not flow from the social engineering of top leaders, professional experts and technical elites. They have only created space for the bloated size of elites and bureaucracy struggling for privileges inverse to the belief of modernisation theorists but by the conscious participation of people from below. Stabilisation of change demands building institutions, values and procedures that sustain the physical and economic security of people. Structurally entrenched interests habitually prefer the status quo and lend their support to matching policies. This does not threaten their wealth and power by the catalysts of change agents seeking freedom, entitlements and opportunities.

A perceptual gap exists between Nepali leaders and scholars, as the former believe that people join the international labour market by choice to see the external world, not by their wretched condition of living at home. The awakened social conscience of scholars, however, perceives this situation differently. They expose leaders' unproven beliefs and criticize their migration and citizenship policies. They equally favour a productive and embedded economy which can create jobs for people within the nation, enabling them to exercise their sovereign power in all vital aspects of national life, not just remittance collectors.

Ironically the stream of countless regime change and mercurial style of politics without its positive effects on desirable governance hints the present as carry-over of the past, not the imagination of a better future whose hope seems hazy. The continuity of the traits of the ancien regime marks the spectacle of feudalism and aristocracy against the lower classes of people aspiring to create political conditions for responsive politics. Many Nepali political parties have internalised these traits and, therefore, often sense a fear of the outcome of the egalitarian impulse of the constitution. The demand for inner party democracy and democratisation of leaders add stamina to the struggle of Nepali youth for intergenerational justice.

It entails the sharing of political power by each class and generation of people and reciprocity as per their numerical strength. Senior leaders are torn between the legacy of ideology and human psychology that fosters pragmatism in power lust. This pragmatism has created a paradox between the national heritage of freedom and the modern aspiration of secularisation and materialisation of political life in spite of deep dependency and corresponding loss of policy sovereignty. Those indulged in revolutionary adventure seek a break from the pattern of internal and external relations of the nation based on the dependency model of development, for a more indigenous one, as the former pushes Nepalis to marginalisation, causing political uprising against the condition of living.

While the new leaders and elites are acculturated in technological dreams lack reflective awareness and refuse to indigenise public policies to fit native reality. The other factor is adaptation of its constitutional and political structures and roles to the dynamic forces of society — critical mass, civil society, people’s activism, mass media, economy and technology. The rise of cult figures in Nepali politics has made them a contested site. It affronted popular sovereignty and the divinity of people, Janata Janardan and incited contradictions, factions, cracks, alienation and apathy within the leadership structures.

It is vital to keep a balance between the pluralist models of the Nepali state’s imperative of security, rule of law, public order and opposition forces, acting as counterbalancers of power demanding legitimate space, recognition and justice. The constitution has given every Nepali equal political rights but the income gap prevents them to realise these rights. The imbalance between the property rights of people and the distributional social struggle has created conditions ripe for a change in politics. Political parties of Nepal have become powerful enough to control the former governance but failed to make them responsive to public goods. The de-ideologisation of political leaders has made their solidarity and justification void to serve the interests of various classes and eroded their power of collective action.

Now ideologies of Nepali parties are no longer regarded as instruments of change. The nation has tested all ideologies and their efficacy to project a human face remains cloudy. They no longer serve policy alternatives for desirable change. The winner-takes-all version of politics has created more losers of power and inflamed their restlessness for political change. Each election has socialised people with amazing expectations and resulting frustration, thus making political conditions amenable to stir, change and transformation. When the polity cannot maintain its internal vision with the zeitgeist, the external stimuli exert pressure for change to conform to its values, principle and rules.

Nepal’s polity has habitually faced pressure to adopt democracy, human rights, market economy, educational, health and administrative reforms and sectoral rights to women, Dalits, indigenous people, minorities, labour and professional groups. These elements and their social energy have propelled the Nepali polity and constitution to eternal change. People engage in revolt for change if they find a gap between their constitutional ideals and the practice of leadership culture. The Nepali constitution is a vital document to bring all forces into national coherence. But when powerful actors do not follow its rules, politics prepares ground to organise people into alternative parties and associations, mobilise the victims of society and catalyze them into action for political change.

Now Nepali leaders of all hues are caught in a blind alley and forced to steer politics without the ideology they were indoctrinated with for long. Social movements also run too far beyond the ability of social scientists to conceptualize and use their insight for adaptation to change. Human instinct and economy have consumed the efficacy of ideology in political life. While Nepali corporate media treat politics as a stage for entertainment, old leaders are vulnerable to its choreographed messages, advertisement and manipulation of public opinion. New forces, however, feel that they provide an opportunity for personality projection and competitive leverage in the power struggle with their counterparts.

This entertaining politics exonerates Nepali leaders from public policy responsibility and disconnects them from the aspiration for change in the style of governance that is honest, transparent and accountable. Social media, by contrast, constantly nurses people’s interests, controls political narratives and instantly provides various incentives for their users to unlearn the deeds of old leaders and shape counter public opinion. This media has made big advances toward inclusiveness with the ubiquity of mobiles and exposing Nepalis to the world of critical politics, thus eroding authority structures.

Personalised politics

Change in information technology is attuned to the value of personalised politics. It has eased horizontal networking across young generations of people and challenged old parties built on hierarchy, patriarchy and leader-oriented inflexible structures. New technologies are exposing the illusion of engineering democracy and prosperity benefitting people and inflaming their passion for new modernity, identity and opportunity for good governance. It requires systemic change in the structure and political culture to cope with the myriad of longstanding challenges Nepal is facing.

Will there be a meaningful policy change when the old political classes and new forces have the same social vision of migration, economic policy of neoliberalism and political pragmatism? Will there be a change in institutional culture that can make public institutions autonomous of dominant interest groups and agents of the deep state so that public policy adopted by the state remains appropriate and functional, thus serving public goods? It is obviously something that cannot be answered in advance. Serious political inquiry is essential.

Trump signs order for global 10 per cent tariff on all countries - Nepal News,Trump signs order for global 10 per cent tariff on all countries  Nepal News,2026-02-21 02:58:21,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOZ1ZLNFN0X08wNEp4cjBRSy1jQ0R2dGpZbEV3QnBFZkdPRWdxQ282TzFnZlM3RUNfbjJqV3lhS19iSUkydjcwTUhmRWMtdDhLS3pxbGl2cHlNWDNOdUN1LTJQalJZaHpoSlozNHVwQnJBQm4ycW52Z0ZSNVZLT0dRTVl6cVZiWVBDZGRQWFJZcU5RTmprNE1xdVYtWW9fYWJsdGtEMmtia3hkRXVpZjNUbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://english.nepalnews.com,Nepal News,"WASHINGTON DC: US President Donald Trump on Friday (US local time) signed an order making 10 per cent global tariff on all countries, effective “almost immediately”.

Sharing the announcement in a post on Truth Social, the US President said, “It is my Great Honor to have just signed, from the Oval Office, a Global 10% Tariff on all Countries, which will be effective almost immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! President Donald Trump

A White House official stated that this new tariff will remain in place until another authority is invoked, emphasising the expectation that trade partners abide by US trade deals.

The official also advised all the trade partners to abide by the trade deals. The new 10% global tariff is part of Trump’s protectionist trade agenda, aimed at addressing balance-of-payments issues and unfair trade practices.

US President Donald Trump announced 10 per cent global tariffs “effective immediately,” following a major legal defeat at the US Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Trump administration exceeded its legal authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977 to impose broad-based import tariffs.

Terming SC’s ruling as a “terrible decision”, Trump announced he would sign an executive order for a 10% global tariff under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. This authority allows for a temporary import surcharge (up to 15%) for 150 days to address balance-of-payments deficits.

“Effective immediately, all the national security tariffs under Section 232 and existing Section 301 tariffs remain in place… Today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under Section 122 over and above our normal tariffs already being charged,” he said.

Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Neil Gorsuch, Amy Coney Barrett, and the three liberal justices, held that the IEEPA does not explicitly authorise the president to levy duties–a power the Constitution assigns to Congress.

Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented, supporting the administration’s broader interpretation of emergency powers.

The ruling invalidated billions of dollars in “reciprocal” and emergency tariffs, potentially requiring the government to refund approximately $130-$175 billion in collected revenue.

US Supreme Court has held that the US President did not possess the authority under IEEPA to impose extensive import duties on goods from nearly all US trading partners.

Trump has already stated that “alternatives will be used” to replace the tariffs that the court has “incorrectly rejected.”

“Other alternatives will now be used to replace the ones that the court incorrectly rejected. We have alternatives. Could be more money, we will take in more money… We have taken in hundreds of billions of dollars. We will continue to do so,” he said.

Trump, referring to the decision as “ludicrous”, added that this decision benefits other countries but not the US. He further alleged that the courts are “swayed by foreign interests.”

“Foreign countries that have been ripping us off for years are ecstatic. They are dancing in the streets, but they won’t be dancing for long… Those justices are a disgrace to our nation… The court has been swayed by foreign interests and a political movement that is far smaller than people would ever think,” he said.

Trump specifically noted that “The India deal is on,” suggesting that recent bilateral trade agreements–including the reduction of reciprocal tariffs to 18%–would be maintained through these new legal pathways.

The ruling is expected to have wide-ranging consequences for global trade, businesses, consumers, inflation trends and household finances across the country.

The financial implications of the ruling are substantial. The tariffs in question cover trillions of dollars in trade, and the US government collected nearly USD 134 billion in levies through December 14 under the contested authority, The Washington Post reported.

US stock indexes rose following the ruling, as investors anticipated a reduction in inflationary pressure, though gains were tempered by Trump’s immediate vow to reimpose new levies.

The administration also launched new investigations into “unfair trade practices” under Section 301, which could lead to more permanent, targeted duties.

Trump emphasised that tariffs previously imposed under Section 232 (National Security) and existing Section 301 (Unfair Trade) remain “in full force and effect,” as they were not affected by the IEEPA ruling. (ANI)

सुप्रीम कोर्ट न॑ ६-३ के फैसला करलकै कि ट्रंप प्रशासन न॑ १९७७ केरऽ अंतर्राष्ट्रीय आपातकालीन आर्थिक शक्ति अधिनियम (आईईईपीए) के इस्तेमाल करी क॑ व्यापक आधार प॑ आयात शुल्क लगाय क॑ अपनऽ कानूनी अधिकार स॑ अधिक होय गेलै ।

अनुसूचित जाति केरऽ फैसला क॑ “भयानक फैसला” बताबैत॑ हुअ॑ ट्रंप न॑ घोषणा करलकै कि हुनी १९७४ केरऽ व्यापार अधिनियम केरऽ धारा १२२ के तहत १०% वैश्विक टैरिफ केरऽ कार्यकारी आदेश प॑ हस्ताक्षर करतै ।ई प्राधिकरण म॑ भुगतान संतुलन घाटा क॑ दूर करै लेली १५० दिन लेली अस्थायी आयात सरचार्ज (१५% तलक) के अनुमति छै ।

ओ कहला जे तुरंत प्रभावी भ कए धारा 232 आ मौजूदा धारा 301 क तहत सबटा राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा टैरिफ लागू अछि... आइ हम धारा 122 क तहत पहिने स लेल जा रहल हमर सामान्य टैरिफ स बेसी आ ओहि स बेसी 10% वैश्विक टैरिफ लगेबाक आदेश पर हस्ताक्षर करब।

मुख्य न्यायाधीश जॉन रॉबर्ट्स, जस्टिस नील गोरसुच, एमी कोनी बैरेट, आरू तीनों उदार न्यायाधीशऽ के साथ, न॑ कहलकै कि आईईईपीए राष्ट्रपति क॑ शुल्क लेबै के स्पष्ट रूप स॑ अधिकृत नै करै छै-एक शक्ति संविधान कांग्रेस क॑ सौंपलकै ।

जस्टिस सैमुअल अलिटो, क्लेरेंस थॉमस, आरू ब्रेट कवानो न॑ एकरऽ असहमत छेलै, जेकरा म॑ प्रशासन केरऽ आपातकालीन शक्ति केरऽ व्यापक व्याख्या के समर्थन करलऽ गेलै ।

ई फैसला स॑ अरबों डॉलर केरऽ “पारस्परिक” आरू आपातकालीन टैरिफ क॑ अमान्य करी देलऽ गेलै, जेकरा स॑ संभावित रूप स॑ सरकार क॑ लगभग १३०-१७५ अरब डॉलर के एकत्रित राजस्व वापस करै ल॑ पड़तै ।

अमेरिकी सुप्रीम कोर्ट न॑ कहलकै कि अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति के पास आईईईपीए के तहत लगभग सब अमेरिकी व्यापारिक भागीदारऽ के सामान प॑ व्यापक आयात शुल्क लगै के अधिकार नै छेलै ।

ट्रंप न॑ पहल॑ ही कहल॑ छै कि कोर्ट न॑ “गलत तरीका स॑ खारिज” करलऽ गेलऽ टैरिफ के जगह प॑ “विकल्प के इस्तेमाल” करलऽ जैतै ।

ओ कहला जे आब ओहि विकल्प कए बदलबा लेल आन विकल्प क उपयोग कैल जाएत, जेकरा कोर्ट गलत तरीका स खारिज करि देलक, हमरा सब लग विकल्प अछि, बेसी टका भ सकैत अछि, हम बेसी टका लेब... हम सैकड़ों अरब डॉलर क आमदनी केलहुं अछि, हम सब अहिना करैत रहब।

ट्रंप नँ ई फैसला क “हास्यास्पद” बताबैत कहलकै कि ई फैसला स॑ दोसरऽ देशऽ क॑ फायदा होय छै लेकिन अमेरिका क॑ नै । हुनी आगू आरोप लगैलकै कि कोर्ट “विदेशी हित स॑ झूललऽ छै ।”

ओ कहलनि जे, विदेशी देश जे हमरा सब के सालों सं नोचैत आबि रहल अछि, ओ गदगद अछि, सड़क पर नाचैत अछि, मुदा बेसी दिन तक नाचैत नहि रहत... ओ न्यायाधीश हमर राष्ट्र के लेल बेइज्जती अछि... कोर्ट विदेशी हित आओर एकटा एहन राजनीतिक आंदोलन सं झूलल अछि जे लोक के सोच सं कहीं छोट अछि.

ट्रंप न॑ विशेष रूप स॑ नोट करलकै कि “भारत सौदा चालू छै,” जेकरा स॑ पता चलै छै कि हाल केरऽ द्विपक्षीय व्यापार समझौता – जेकरा म॑ पारस्परिक टैरिफ क॑ १८% तलक घटाना भी शामिल छै – क॑ ई नया कानूनी मार्गऽ के माध्यम स॑ कायम रखलऽ जैतै ।

उम्मीद छै कि ई फैसला केरऽ व्यापक परिणाम देश भर केरऽ वैश्विक व्यापार, व्यवसाय, उपभोक्ता, महंगाई केरऽ रुझान आरू घरेलू वित्त प॑ पड़ै के उम्मीद छै ।

एहि फैसला क आर्थिक प्रभाव काफी अछि। द वाशिंगटन पोस्ट केरऽ रिपोर्ट के मुताबिक, सवाल के टैरिफ म॑ खरबों डॉलर के व्यापार शामिल छै, आरू अमेरिकी सरकार न॑ विवादित प्राधिकरण के तहत १४ दिसंबर तलक लगभग १३४ अरब डॉलर के लेवी वसूली करलकै ।

ई फैसला के बाद अमेरिकी शेयर सूचकांक बढ़ी गेलै, कैन्हेंकि निवेशकऽ क॑ महंगाई के दबाव म॑ कमी ​​के आशंका छेलै, हालांकि ट्रंप केरऽ नयका लेवी क॑ दोबारा लगाबै के तत्काल प्रण स॑ ई बढ़ोत्तरी म॑ कमी ​​आबी गेलै ।

प्रशासन न॑ धारा ३०१ के तहत “अनुचित व्यापार प्रथा” के बारे म॑ भी नया जांच शुरू करलकै, जेकरा स॑ अधिक स्थायी, लक्षित कर्तव्य पैदा होय सकै छै ।

ट्रंप नँ ई बात प॑ जोर देलकै कि धारा २३२ (राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा) आरू मौजूदा धारा ३०१ (अनुचित व्यापार) के तहत पहल॑ लगाय देलऽ गेलऽ टैरिफ “पूरी तरह स॑ लागू आरू प्रभावी” छै, कैन्हेंकि ओकरा आईईईपीए केरऽ फैसला स॑ प्रभावित नै करलऽ गेलऽ छेलै । (एएनआई) २.

Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap - Khabarhub,Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap  Khabarhub,2026-02-21 03:22:30,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWEFVX3lxTE52OGxYYTVBSjlOZDRuSXo4d00xdlRGamtTV24zaHllZWtBajdLTmRiSURCV0FpWmtUNFE2QWp1MjlXblEzTDZTOU5CeWNKbk9YMllISTEwRWk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://english.khabarhub.com,Khabarhub,"KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries.

Nepal’s economic and development indicators over the first seven months of fiscal 2025/26 show a mixed yet dynamic picture, reflecting both growth opportunities and structural challenges. Foreign trade expanded to Rs 12.916 billion, driven by a sharp rise in exports, which improved the import-export ratio, though the trade deficit remains significant. The surge in electric vehicle imports highlights a shift toward green technology, while gold and silver prices show market stability.

Life insurance companies and other financial institutions increasingly favor equity investments over low-yield deposits, signaling a strategic adaptation to low interest rates. Government initiatives, including workplace-based training, KAHS infrastructure development, and Rara Lake road upgrades, indicate efforts to strengthen human capital and tourism, although delays and funding gaps persist in health and education projects.

Tourism data reveal robust regional activity in Mustang, contrasted with reduced hotel occupancy in Sauraha due to election-related uncertainties. Meanwhile, policy focus on energy sector expansion and digital voter engagement demonstrates an alignment of political agendas with economic modernization and public participation priorities, suggesting that Nepal’s short-term growth is intertwined with infrastructural, financial, and electoral dynamics.

Foreign trade hits Rs 13 billion in seven months

Nepal’s trade reached Rs 12.916 billion in the first seven months of fiscal year 2025/26, a 15.76% increase from last year, according to the Department of Customs. Imports rose 13.65% to Rs 11.234 billion, and exports surged 32.19% to Rs 1.681 billion. Trade activity peaked in January, likely influenced by the upcoming elections, but the trade deficit grew 10.91% to Rs 9.553 billion.

Electric vehicle imports exceed Rs 13 billion

Nepal imported EVs worth Rs 13.847 billion in the first seven months of the fiscal year, totaling 5,894 vehicles. This generated Rs 8.46 billion in revenue. China supplied 71% of imports (4,204 units), followed by India with 1,263 units and Thailand with 401 units.

Gold stable, silver drops to Rs 5,050 per tola

Gold prices remained steady at Rs 304,700 per tola (11.66 grams), according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver, however, declined by Rs 10 per tola, trading at Rs 5,050.

Life insurance companies invest Rs 42 billion in stock market

Life insurance firms have sharply increased their holdings in the secondary market, reaching Rs 42.403 billion by the second quarter of this fiscal year, up 64.54% from Rs 25.77 billion last year. The move follows a drop in fixed deposit interest rates below 3% at commercial banks. Himalayan Life Insurance led with Rs 12.475 billion, followed by Nepal Life at Rs 6.569 billion, while state-owned National Life Insurance cut its stock exposure by 73.07%.

Finance Minister pledges full support for upcoming polls

During the Nepal Tourism Seminar in Kathmandu, Finance Minister Rameshore Khanal assured that the government would provide all necessary resources for the successful completion of elections. He acknowledged challenges from political instability and noted ongoing policy measures to support economic growth, including interventions in the tourism sector, while prioritizing the electoral process.

Export growth improves import-export ratio

Rising exports have strengthened the country’s trade balance. The import-to-export ratio fell from 7.77:1 to 6.68:1, with exports comprising 13.02% of total trade, up from 11.40%, and imports slightly down to 86.98%. Exports reached Rs 168.145 billion by mid-February, up from Rs 127.204 billion, reflecting strong domestic production and international trade growth.

Energy sector features prominently in party manifestos

Major political parties have prioritized energy in their election agendas. The Nepali Congress targets 14,000 MW capacity and 750 units per capita consumption within five years. CPN (UML) aims to make Nepal a South Asian clean energy hub, and other parties, including CPN (Maoist Centre) and Rastriya Swatantra Party, plan up to 40,000 MW by 2100. Key themes include policy reforms, regional energy cooperation, and private sector investment.

Election Commission launches TikTok contest to engage voters

The Election Commission (EC) is encouraging citizens to create TikTok videos to promote awareness ahead of the March 5 House of Representatives elections. The top video will receive Rs 50,000, with Rs 30,000 and Rs 20,000 for second and third place, respectively. Participants must submit one-minute videos highlighting voter education and election conduct by March 1. The EC can also use winning content for official publicity, aiming to engage younger voters via social media.

Life insurers increase equity exposure amid low interest rates

Thirteen insurers have expanded stock market investments to boost returns. SuryaJyoti Life grew by 100.23% to Rs 4.641 billion, Sanima Reliance Life by 175.19%, while Life Insurance Corporation and IME Life invested Rs 3.116 billion and Rs 2.562 billion, respectively. MetLife Insurance remains the only company without listed shares. The trend reflects a shift from low-yield bank deposits.

Labor Ministry introduces workplace-based training guidelines

The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security has issued new procedures to strengthen workplace-based training and bridge skill gaps in Nepal’s labor market. Under the National Vocational Training Institute Development Committee Order 2024, training programs will range from 390 to 730 hours. Employers are required to guarantee employment after training—for example, one month of training requires a two-month job commitment. During training, the Institute will cover minimum wages and Social Security Fund contributions, aiming to provide skilled manpower while ensuring stable jobs for Nepali workers.

Rs 6 billion KAHS infrastructure project remains stalled

A long-term plan to build 26 faculty buildings at the Karnali Academy of Health Sciences (KAHS) in Chere Chaur, Jumla, is stalled due to funding shortages. Despite a detailed project report for the Rs 6.29 billion project being prepared nine years ago, only a basic science building and administrative block, costing Rs 760 million, have been completed. KAHS, serving 13 districts in Sudurpashchim, continues to hold classes in rented facilities. Registrar Laxmi Chandra Mahat said that although local donors provided 254,366.41 square meters of land, successive governments have not prioritized the budget for this health tourism hub.

Health Minister assures KAHS funding and infrastructure support

During a February 12 visit to Jumla, Health Minister Dr. Sudha Sharma Gautam committed to completing the stalled Rs 6 billion Karnali Academy of Health Sciences (KAHS) project. She pledged budget prioritization and construction of a 6 km access road to Chere Chaur. KAHS currently hosts over 500 staff and students across 12 programs, facing severe residential and academic space shortages.

Budget approved for Rara Lake access road

The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has secured Rs 910 million to blacktop the 15-kilometer road from Baluwa Khola to Diyaragaun, the main route to Rara Lake in Mugu. Shrawan Kumar Mahatara, Chief of Road Division Jumla, credited Infrastructure Minister Madhav Chaulagain and former lawmaker Gyanendra Bahadur Shahi for the funding. Despite operations since fiscal year 2012/13, the 93-kilometer Nagma-Gamgadhi road remained mostly unpaved. The multi-year project aims to improve tourism and economic activity by replacing muddy tracks with asphalt.

Mustang tourist arrivals reach 325,000 in seven months

Tourist arrivals in Mustang totaled 325,558 during the first seven months of the fiscal year, including 69,814 foreign and 252,664 domestic visitors. Inspector Nawaraj Neupane reported a 5.33% decline from last year. Most visitors arrived via the Beni-Jomsom road, with peak traffic in mid-October and mid-November. While Indian tourists primarily visit for Muktinath, about 3% of foreign visitors explore Upper Mustang. Improved road connectivity remains a key driver of tourism growth.

Nepalgunj Customs collects over Rs 11 billion

The Nepalgunj Customs Office in Banke collected Rs 11.046 billion during the first seven months of fiscal 2025/26. Office Chief Janardan Paudel noted an increase of Rs 92.4 million compared to last year, but only 45% of the annual target of Rs 24.545 billion was achieved. Monthly collections ranged from 69% to 88% of targets. Despite the Integrated Check Post at Jamunaha border, the high trade deficit remains a concern.

Sauraha hotel occupancy drops to 50% during peak season

Hotel occupancy in Sauraha, Chitwan, has fallen to 50% during the peak tourist months of February to April, down from the historical 80%. Om Prakash Pandey, President of the Regional Hotel Association Chitwan, linked the drop to the upcoming March 5 election deterring international visitors. The 148 hotels in Sauraha employ around 6,400 people, and the decline in tourists is affecting local livelihoods and related businesses such as elephant safaris.","{'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/uml-flag-fire-150x100.png', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/logo-white-sm.png', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/linked-in.svg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/playstore.svg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/logo-300x300-1-150x150.png', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/appstore.svg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Economic-Digest.jpg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/viber.svg', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAMPDwwAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/instagram.svg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/camera-trapping-350x250.jpg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/icons/youtube.svg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/themes/Khabarhubenglish/img/logos.png', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/CCTV.jpg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nepal-portugal2-150x100.jpg', 'https://english.khabarhub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Khabar-Hub-News_Accident_1200px-630X-px-Final_2021.01.21-Upload-e1748330914908-150x100.webp'}","काठमांडू : इकोनॉमिक डाइजेस्ट नेपाल केरऽ महत्वपूर्ण व्यापारिक घटना केरऽ संक्षिप्त लेकिन व्यापक अवलोकन प्रदान करै छै, जेकरा आसानी स॑ पचै योग्य सारांश म॑ प्रस्तुत करलऽ गेलऽ छै ।

Dubbed the “Commitment Paper 2082” and anchored by the “100 Pillars of Policy Departure,” the document signals the party’s ambitious agenda to reshape administrative structures, boost productivity, and chart a bold course for Nepal’s future.

Framing a roadmap for government formation after March 05 and the forthcoming budget, RSP outlined plans for radical transformation in the national economy and governance structures. The manifesto emphasises productivity-led growth, institutional reform, and transparency, signalling the party’s intent to reshape Nepal’s economic and political landscape.

RSP has pledged to conditionally release cooperative and microfinance operators jailed for fraud while reforming the sector’s weak oversight. Nepal News takes a closer look at the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) manifesto and breaks down its key promises and vision. Here is everything you need to know about the party’s plans, from its economic, foreign policy agenda and productivity-led growth strategies to reforms in governance, the judiciary, and political parties.

What is RSP’s manifesto on constitutional reform and national consensus-building?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) plans to initiate comprehensive constitutional reform immediately upon taking office. Within the first three months, the party will prepare a “Discussion Paper” to engage political stakeholders, experts, and the public, aiming to build broad national consensus on necessary amendments.

The core concepts RSP intends to propose include: a directly elected executive to strengthen accountability; a fully proportional parliament to ensure fair representation; a system in which Members of Parliament cannot simultaneously serve as ministers, maintaining separation of powers; non-partisan local governments to promote local democracy; and an improved provincial structure for effective governance and resource distribution.

What is RSP’s manifesto on judicial reform and institutional governance?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) aims to establish a judicial system based on meritocracy, transparency, and accountability, free from political influence and factional sharing. The party plans to end party-driven or “sharing-based” recommendations in appointments to the High Court and Supreme Court, replacing them with a competitive, merit-based selection process. Judges chosen on merit will be recommended to the Judicial Council, while ensuring constitutional provisions for reservation and inclusivity are fully respected.

To increase judicial transparency, RSP will explore the live broadcast of court proceedings, allowing citizens to witness hearings and hold the judiciary accountable.

In terms of institutional governance, RSP will amend key laws, including the CIAA Act, Constitutional Council Act, and Judicial Council Act, to strengthen the independence, clarity, and accountability of constitutional bodies. The party will clearly define the policy decision-making authority of the Cabinet to prevent legal loopholes or exploitation by interest groups. Furthermore, all bills will include a financial and regulatory impact analysis, ensuring that legislation is both effective and aligned with national interests.

What is RSP’s manifesto on political party reform?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) seeks to strengthen democracy, reduce corruption, and ensure leadership accountability through comprehensive political party reform. The party plans to provide annual grants to nationally recognized political parties based on the number of votes they receive, ensuring transparent public funding tied to electoral performance.

To prevent the concentration of power and the repeated re-election of the same individuals, RSP will amend the Political Parties Act and Election Act, closing loopholes that allow money misuse and political entrenchment. Leadership within political parties will also be time-bound, with party heads limited to two terms, promoting regular leadership transition, internal democracy, and renewal within parties.

What is RSP’s manifesto on foreign policy and diplomacy?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) places Nepal’s sovereignty, geographical integrity, and national interest above all else and adopts a policy of Balanced and Dynamic Diplomacy to turn shifting global geopolitics and the rise of neighboring powers into concrete opportunities for national development. Recognizing the strategic interests of neighboring countries and changes in the global power balance, RSP aims to safeguard Nepal’s interests by transforming the country from a “buffer state” into a “vibrant bridge” through trilateral economic cooperation, regional connectivity, and mutually beneficial partnerships.

RSP will renew development partnership models so Nepal can benefit from the rapid progress made by India over the past decade, particularly in digital public infrastructure, high-speed and high-quality physical infrastructure, economic formalization, balanced growth between manufacturing and services, and overall state capacity enhancement. At the same time, RSP will build structured partnership frameworks with China by mobilizing concessional finance for world-class infrastructure, adopting state-guided socio-economic development programs, and learning from effective inter-provincial competition models. Through this balanced approach, RSP seeks to ensure national interest while positioning Nepal as an active, confident, and development-oriented partner in the region.

What is RSP’s manifesto on economic growth, productivity, and structural transformation?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) places continuous productivity growth at the heart of Nepal’s economic transformation, emphasizing strong coordination between a risk-taking private sector and a transparent, facilitating public sector. The party envisions a system where the private sector leads job creation and investment, while the government acts as a regulator and facilitator, eliminating rent-seeking, policy exploitation, and bureaucratic obstacles. RSP recognizes that Nepal must harness its youth demographic dividend over the next 10–15 years to avoid falling into a low-income trap.

Under a social market economy, RSP will establish powerful, professional regulatory bodies free from political interference to curb cartels and unhealthy competition. Progress will be measured not only by income growth but also by job expansion, social harmony, and environmental balance, combining liberal economic policies with equitable redistribution via education, health, and social security.

RSP’s economic targets include repealing or improving laws that hinder business, reducing production costs, and maintaining an average annual growth rate of 7% for the next five years, aiming for a per capita income over $3,000 and a national economy nearing $100 billion within 5–7 years. Tax reforms will reduce burdens on citizens while safeguarding revenue, including adjustments for family expenses in income tax. The party will also study the fixed exchange rate with the Indian Rupee with international expertise.

To facilitate investment, RSP will implement a One-Stop Service Center for approvals covering land, forest, and environmental clearances, along with digital, fast, and free business registration. The Revenue Investigation Department will be replaced by professional chartered accountants to monitor revenue and control corruption. Public enterprises will be restructured—some merged, some moved to Public-Private Partnerships, others decentralized—while public projects will be executed in “Mission Mode” with fixed budgets, timelines, and accountability for project heads.

RSP will prioritize National Pride Projects, completing stalled projects within two years and introducing 10 new fast-track, diversified projects in areas like sports, research, and specialized healthcare. Financial regulation will strengthen supervision over cooperatives, microfinance, and non-banking sectors, linking them to the Credit Information Center to prevent over-indebtedness and predatory lending. Small depositors will be protected via an Integrated Savings Protection Fund, and predatory lending will be classified as an economic crime, with digital verification required for large transactions.

Capital markets will be reformed through restructuring of SEBON, NEPSE, and CDSC to allow private sector participation, introduce intraday trading, derivatives, and zero tolerance for insider trading. Investment will be expanded through pension funds, insurance, mutual funds, infrastructure bonds, and access for Non-Resident Nepalis (NRNs), alongside the creation of a commodity exchange under a Public Warehousing Act.

RSP emphasizes a borderless, knowledge-based economy, shifting from labor exports to service exports and IT-driven growth. The Information Technology sector will be declared a National Strategic Industry, with a goal to increase IT exports from $1.5 billion to $30 billion in 10 years, supported by an autonomous IT Promotion Board and Digital Parks in all seven provinces, making Nepal a competitive hub for innovation, digital services, and economic transformation.

What is RSP’s manifesto on energy development, consumption, and export?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has set an ambitious goal of achieving 30,000 MW of installed electricity capacity within the next decade, positioning energy as a backbone of Nepal’s economic transformation. To fast-track projects, land acquisition and environmental clearance laws will be amended so that the Ministry of Energy can manage all approvals through a single-window service delivery system, replacing the current fragmented structure involving multiple ministries and departments. The government will also take full responsibility for security arrangements throughout hydropower project timelines.

To realize the objectives of the Energy Development Decade, RSP will introduce a new energy and water resources policy and create strong legal and institutional frameworks to encourage private sector participation across the entire energy value chain. This includes not only generation, but also battery storage, pump storage, technology-based storage systems, transmission, and distribution. The energy trade sector will be opened to private investment, generation licenses will be extended from 35 to 50 years, and legal provisions will enable electricity from solar power, rooftop solar systems, and agro-based solar farms to be sold to the national grid through net-metering. Additional incentives will promote solar farms on barren hill lands with irrigation access.

RSP will prioritize increasing domestic electricity consumption by ensuring land availability, expanding transmission lines, and modernizing distribution systems. Energy-intensive industries—such as steel, cement, herbal processing, data centers, and chemical fertilizer production—will be actively attracted. Electricity tariffs will be restructured, including a special household tariff, to encourage higher usage, with a clear target of raising per capita electricity consumption to 1,500 kWh by 2035.

What is RSP’s manifesto on building a digital economy and transforming Nepal into a technology-driven nation?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) envisions a comprehensive digital transformation that positions Nepal as a global hub for technology, innovation, and digital services. The party plans to invest heavily in data centers, cloud infrastructure, and high-speed connectivity, while adopting independent and secure digital systems through satellites and advanced technologies to reduce reliance on foreign platforms. Public procurement will prioritize software developed within Nepal, and the Nepal Postal Service will be modernized into a tech-friendly, multipurpose delivery hub capable of supporting e-commerce, logistics, and digital services.

RSP aims to make Nepal a digital-first nation by removing legal and technical hurdles for international payment gateways, fostering a cashless economy to improve transparency and reduce corruption. IT services and software exports will benefit from automatic cash incentives and full income tax exemptions for multiple years, encouraging startups and global competitiveness.

The party also plans to transform Nepal’s energy advantage into a technology export opportunity. Within five years, Nepal will evolve from an exporter of raw electricity to an exporter of Artificial Intelligence and computational power, using clean energy to run server farms and data centers. Instead of selling electricity alone, the country will sell high-value server processing time. A national cryptocurrency policy will be established in the first year, and pilot projects for crypto mining will be developed based on energy availability.

To harness global talent and opportunities, RSP will legally recognize remote work and cross-border service exports by amending the Labor Act. Banking and foreign exchange policies will be improved to facilitate payments for individuals working for foreign companies from Nepal. Additionally, the party will introduce digital nomad visas, co-working centers, and supportive infrastructure to attract international remote workers, positioning Nepal as a modern, innovation-driven economy with both domestic and global impact.

Why does the RSP manifesto propose reviewing Nepal’s fixed exchange rate with the Indian Rupee?

In point 23 of its manifesto, the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) states: “While a fixed exchange rate with the Indian Rupee has been maintained for three decades, we will conduct a study and review of this system with the participation of distinguished international experts.” This makes RSP the first political party in Nepal to openly propose reviewing the long-standing pegged currency system. While the manifesto does not specify why the review is necessary or what alternatives may be considered, the move signals the party’s interest in examining the suitability of Nepal’s pegged system in the modern economic context.

Nepal has maintained a fixed exchange rate with the Indian Rupee since 1993, pegging 1 INR = 1.6 NPR, primarily to facilitate trade, remittances, and investment from India, its largest trading partner. Analysts highlight multiple advantages of this arrangement, including exchange rate stability, inflation control, and the facilitation of cross-border trade and investment. By minimizing currency fluctuations, the peg reduces transaction costs for businesses, lowers uncertainty for investors, and strengthens bilateral economic ties.

India is Nepal’s largest trading partner, accounting for over 64% of total trade, the main source of foreign investment, and the sole provider of trade transit for the landlocked nation.

A pegged currency system, also known as a fixed exchange rate, links a nation’s currency value to another currency or a basket of currencies, providing a predictable environment for international trade and investment. Maintaining the peg requires careful monetary management by the central bank to stabilize the money supply and inflation, contributing to a more stable macroeconomic environment-a factor that supports long-term growth, investor confidence, and economic planning.

What is RSP’s plan to modernize tourism services and strengthen mountain tourism safety?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) aims to modernize Nepal’s tourism sector by making it digital, safe, and globally competitive. A unified digital platform will be developed to integrate study permits, trekking permits, national parks, tourism offices, heritage sites, and all permit, ticket, and fee systems into a single interface. This reform will significantly reduce time, cost, and administrative burden for tourists while improving transparency and service quality.

RSP will introduce major reforms in mountain tourism safety and management, particularly in the Himalayan region. The region will be classified into three altitude categories from 6,000 to 8,000 meters, and modern technologies such as drones and digital monitoring systems will be deployed to strengthen safety, search, and rescue operations—especially for climbers above 6,000 meters.

Leveraging Nepal’s geographical advantage, RSP will also implement targeted policies to develop hill stations in mountainous areas located within 1.5 hours of the India–Nepal border, promoting short-stay tourism, regional connectivity, and local economic growth while diversifying Nepal’s tourism offerings beyond traditional destinations.

What is RSP’s plan for strengthening Nepal’s international airports and aviation infrastructure?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) aims to fully operationalize and strategically expand Nepal’s airport infrastructure to support tourism, trade, and economic growth. Pokhara International Airport and Gautam Buddha International Airport will be brought into full operation by making existing fee-exemption arrangements more effective, ensuring strong international marketing, and undertaking diplomatic initiatives with India to improve entry–exit arrangements and enable ILS (Instrument Landing System) operations.

The capacity of Tribhuvan International Airport will be increased, and the design of the already-prepared new international terminal will be promptly revised to accelerate construction. Looking to the future, RSP will develop plans for a new international airport based on in-depth studies of Nepal’s long-term market demand and global aviation trends, with construction planned for Nijgadh or another suitable alternative location.

To maximize economic impact, airports will be connected to major cities through road and rail networks, with financing managed through a balanced mix of public and private investment, ensuring sustainability, efficiency, and long-term national benefit.

What is RSP’s manifesto on civil aviation reform?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) is committed to comprehensive civil aviation reform to improve safety, governance, and global credibility. The party will separate regulatory functions and service delivery roles within the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal by establishing independent bodies, ensuring transparency and eliminating conflicts of interest. To restore international confidence, aviation safety audits will be conducted by international audit teams, with the clear goal of removing Nepal from the global aviation blacklist.

RSP will also reform Nepal Airlines by fully freeing it from political influence and interference. Management and operational responsibility will be opened to experienced private-sector airline operators through competitive processes, while retaining 51 percent government ownership. Financial restructuring will be undertaken with private sector participation, followed by a long-term plan to list the airline on the stock exchange. At the same time, Nepal Airlines will be expanded through a lean, transparent, and corruption-free process, increasing flight capacity by acquiring additional aircraft through open competition and professional management.

What is RSP’s manifesto on investigating illegal wealth and ensuring accountability?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) is committed to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law in addressing the accumulation of illegal wealth by public officials. The party will conduct thorough, legal, and transparent investigations into the assets of individuals who have held significant public office since 2046 B.S. (1990).

Clear and standardized procedures will be established to identify assets that have been illegally acquired. Once proven, such assets will be effectively seized and nationalized, ensuring that the benefits of misappropriated wealth are returned to the state. Through this approach, RSP aims to deter corruption, uphold integrity in public office, and strengthen public trust in governance, sending a clear message that no one is above the law.

What is RSP’s manifesto on administrative reform and building a professional civil service?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) aims to transform Nepal’s administration into a professional, neutral, accountable, and efficient civil service. To achieve this, party-affiliated trade unions within government service will be abolished, ensuring that administrative work is free from political influence. The civil service will be modernized with a principle of “fewer people providing more service”, redistributing unnecessary manpower from central offices to frontline service delivery points. Allowances will be standardized, timely, and integrated into basic salaries, and a Civil Service Bill will institutionalize performance-based evaluation, promotions, and career development while legally ending party affiliation across all government positions.

To maintain stability and institutional memory, RSP will establish an Autonomous Transfer Board that ensures predictable transfers, keeping employees in their area of expertise for a minimum duration. Salaries will be revised to ensure a dignified standard of living for civil servants.

RSP will also drive a paperless administration, ending the traditional manual “Tippani” system and making decision-making tech-friendly. Process audits will reduce delays, with files automatically approved or officials held accountable if deadlines are missed. Key services—such as birth registration, social security, licenses, and business registration—will become digital, transparent, and accessible via platforms like tippani.gov.np and paripatra.gov.np, with legally mandated digital signatures to ensure efficiency, accountability, and citizen convenience.

What is RSP’s manifesto on agricultural transformation and productivity?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) aims to re-establish agriculture as a dignified and profitable profession, ensuring that farmers can achieve wealth through stable markets, transparent subsidies, and modern technology. Agriculture will be directly linked to national food and nutritional security, making it a cornerstone of sustainable development.

To strengthen domestic production, RSP will promote import substitution by negotiating trade agreements and providing tax and customs exemptions for industries that add value to agricultural products. Innovations in Fintech and Agritech will be expanded to improve access to finance, data, and modern farming solutions.

RSP will also optimize land use and productivity by reviewing land-use plans to utilize barren land effectively and promoting land pooling. Investments in irrigation, fertilizers, and mechanization will be prioritized to lower production costs and improve yields. The Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC) will be restructured to strengthen research, innovation, and support for farmers nationwide.

How does RSP view the role of the Nepali diaspora in national development?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) regards Nepalis living abroad as a central force for Nepal’s economic transformation and global influence. Guided by the principle “Once a Nepali, Always a Nepali,” the party recognizes the strong emotional and national bond of Non-Resident Nepalis and seeks to institutionalize their role in nation-building.

RSP supports voting rights for Nepalis abroad and stands in favor of dual citizenship in principle, with limited exceptions based on national interest. Long-standing administrative barriers related to property rights will be removed immediately to ensure dignity, security, and ease for the diaspora.

To mobilize diaspora capital, RSP will provide special legal protection, simplify access to foreign-currency (Dollar) accounts, and ensure clear legal provisions for the repatriation of returns, encouraging investment in large infrastructure, innovation, and productive sectors. Beyond financial contributions, RSP will establish a National Knowledge Bank to directly connect the expertise, skills, and technology of Nepalis abroad with Nepal’s education, health, and industrial development.

RSP also envisions Nepalis worldwide serving as Volunteer Ambassadors, promoting Nepal’s tourism, culture, and investment opportunities. Through the global spread of the Nepali language, art, and identity, the diaspora will strengthen Nepal’s soft power and enhance the country’s standing on the world stage.

What is RSP’s manifesto on border security?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) is committed to protecting Nepal’s geographical integrity while firmly controlling illegal activities in border areas. To achieve this, RSP will mobilize the Armed Police Force (APF) as a specialized Border Security Force, equipped with modern technology, adequate manpower, and strong physical infrastructure dedicated exclusively to border management.

Advanced systems such as night-vision cameras, drone surveillance, and digital entry–exit record mechanisms will be implemented at border checkpoints to effectively control smuggling, illegal trafficking, and cross-border crimes. Alongside strengthened security measures, RSP will pursue high-level diplomatic initiatives to permanently resolve border disputes and review old treaties and agreements through institutional dialogue based on facts and evidence, ensuring that national interests are protected through credible and sustainable solutions rather than sentiment alone.

What is RSP’s manifesto on addressing Dalit rights and ending caste-based discrimination?

Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) acknowledges that the Dalit community in Nepal has faced generations of injustice, exploitation, exclusion, and social stigma due to entrenched social structures, state laws, policies, and societal behavior. This historical discrimination has resulted in high and persistent poverty, prevented the community from developing its skills and potential, and slowed societal progress in technology and modernization.

RSP pledges that the new Head of Government will, in their first address, formally apologize on behalf of the Nepal State for the caste-based discrimination and exclusion endured by Dalit and other marginalized communities. Beyond symbolic gestures, the party will implement robust legal, policy, and institutional reforms to dismantle structural discrimination, promote social inclusion, and create equal opportunities for all, ensuring that marginalized communities are empowered to participate fully in Nepal’s development and modernization.","{'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SOCIAL-MEDIA.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/arrested.jpeg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/fad54f67-7709-469c-8cb7-83dc0933a737.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/air-quality.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/1000049019.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NEPAL-POLICE.jpeg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gold.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/change.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Accident-2.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cloudy-day.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ElectionCommission_BhashaSharma-1536x725-1.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Nepal-news-white.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/direct-flight.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Donald-1.webp', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/RSP.jpeg'}","काठमाण्डु, मिथिला मिरर: नेपाल 5 मार्च के चुनाव के लेल तैयार भ रहल अछि त राष्ट्रीय स्वतंत्र पार्टी 22 पन्ना के घोषणापत्र के अनावरण केलक अछि जाहि में शासन सं ल क अर्थव्यवस्था तक व्यापक सुधार के वादा करैत 100 नीतिगत प्रतिबद्धता के रूपरेखा देल गेल अछि। “प्रतिबद्धता पत्र २०८२” नाम सँ जानलौ गेलौ आरू “नीति प्रस्थान के १०० स्तंभ” स॑ लंगर लगाय देलऽ गेलऽ ई दस्तावेज प्रशासनिक संरचना क॑ नया रूप दै, उत्पादकता बढ़ाबै, आरू नेपाल के भविष्य लेली एगो बोल्ड कोर्स बनाबै के पार्टी केरऽ महत्वाकांक्षी एजेंडा के संकेत दै छै ।

President Trump is invoking his authority under section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which empowers the President to address certain fundamental international payment problems through surcharges and other special import restrictions.

Section 122 authorises the US president to impose temporary tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days to address what the law describes as “large and serious” US balance-of-payments deficits – situations where imports significantly exceed exports.

Tariffs imposed under Section 122 automatically expire after 150 days unless Congress votes to extend them. While the time limit is explicit, trade experts note that a president could allow the measures to lapse and potentially reintroduce them by declaring a fresh balance-of-payments emergency.

The Trump Administration said it is committed to continue implementing the President’s trade policy, which was at the core of his campaign and agend.

USTR said in a statement. “For many months, the Trump Administration has cautioned foreign trading partners and the business community that if the Supreme Court were to limit the President’s authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA, alternative tools would be implemented to address many of the issues at the heart of the President’s reciprocal tariff program.” (ANI)","{'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/air-quality.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Donald-Trump-1.webp', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/trump-3.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gold.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/change.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/japan-2.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cloudy-day.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/donald-1.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Nepal-news-white.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ANTONY.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Vance-on.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/india-1.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Donald-1.webp', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/direct-flight.png'}","आय राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप न॑ एगो घोषणापत्र प॑ हस्ताक्षर करलकै जेकरा म॑ मौलिक अंतर्राष्ट्रीय भुगतान समस्या के समाधान आरू प्रशासन केरऽ काम जारी रखै लेली अस्थायी आयात शुल्क लगैलऽ गेलऽ छै ताकि अमेरिकी मजदूर, किसान आरू निर्माता क॑ फायदा पहुँचै लेली अपनऽ व्यापारिक संबंधऽ क॑ पुनः संतुलित करलऽ जाय सक॑ ।

For New Delhi, sharing deep economic links like $10 billion annual trade and 70% of Nepal's hydropower exports, any post-poll chaos risks refugee surges into Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, disrupted power supplies, and amplified Chinese influence, turning a youth-driven reset into a strategic vulnerability or bolstered buffer.

Gen-Z vs The Old Order

Add Zee News as a Preferred Source

In September 2025, Nepal's youth, frustrated by elite ‘nepo kids,’ unemployment, corruption, and a social media ban, stormed parliament, sparking clashes that killed many.

Their demands rang clear: immediate parliament dissolution, mass resignations of corrupt leaders, tough anti-corruption laws, job creation programs, and restored digital freedoms.

This fury forced Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's coalition to collapse, leading to parliament's dissolution on October 6, 2025.

Sushila Karki, appointed interim PM outside normal protocols, stabilized the ship, finalized voter rolls for 18.9 million eligible citizens, and set the March 5 polls under a mixed system: 165 first-past-the-post seats and 110 proportional representation slots.

Gen-Z demographic, representing over half of new voter registrations, seeks fulfillment of protest pledges: a directly elected executive, voting rights for Nepali diaspora abroad, citizen-led anti-corruption probes, and economic policies like reopening industries, tourism revival, and job creation to tackle 20% youth unemployment.

They demand transparency, ending ""nepo kids"" elite capture, and digital freedoms after the social media ban that ignited their fury, no more platform restrictions on TikTok, YouTube, or Discord coordination.

Leaders like Miraj Dhungana and Sudan Gurung emphasize ""fresh ideas"" and good governance, refusing to contest unless ""bottom-line"" conditions like these are met. Celebrities and influencers amplify calls for thoughtful voting to avoid past instability, according to the Kathmandu Post.

Gen Z influence is booming with over 675,000 youth registered to vote after the protests, fueling 123 parties with one-third new, like Gen Z groups led by Kishori Karki, the highest since 2006.

Nepali Congress woos them with 40% youth quotas in leadership, UML ramps up outreach too.

What Does Nepal's Election hold for New Delhi?

Nepal's March 5 general election holds high stakes for New Delhi, primarily through border stability, economic ties, and countering China's influence.

India seeks a credible poll outcome to end Nepal's post-protest limbo under interim PM Sushila Karki, preventing chaos along the 1,800 km open border.

Past unrest spiked refugees into Bihar and Uttar Pradesh; a stable government ensures Terai calm, Gurkha recruitment continuity, and curbs extremism risks.

New Delhi backed Karki's timeline via NSA Ajit Doval's talks with leaders like Prachanda, emphasising elections as key to political transition.

A stable post-poll government in Kathmandu could fast-track hydropower plants and roads, spurring shared growth beyond Oli's delays.

The election could reshape regional stability by either consolidating a credible government post-Gen Z protests or prolonging political uncertainty, influencing South Asia's security, economy, and power dynamics.
