According to a statement issued by Thames Valley Police, a man in his sixties from Norfolk was arrested on February 19 as part of an ongoing investigation.

Police said searches were being carried out at addresses in Berkshire and Norfolk. The suspect remains in custody.

“We will not be naming the arrested man, as per national guidance. Please also remember that this case is now active so care should be taken with any publication to avoid being in contempt of court,” the force said in a statement.

Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright of Thames Valley Police said, “Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office. It is important that we protect the integrity and objectivity of our investigation as we work with our partners to investigate this alleged offence. We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”

According to CNN, police arrived early Thursday at Sandringham, the private Norfolk estate of King Charles III, where Andrew had recently moved after vacating his long-time residence at Windsor.

The Sandringham estate falls under the jurisdiction of Norfolk Constabulary, which confirmed it is supporting the Thames Valley Police investigation.

Police had earlier said they were reviewing allegations that a woman was trafficked to the UK by Epstein to have a sexual encounter with Andrew, CNN reported.

Authorities were also examining claims that Andrew shared sensitive information with Epstein while serving as the UK’s trade envoy.

Andrew has previously denied all allegations, stating that he never witnessed or suspected any of Epstein’s criminal activities and has not commented on the latest allegations relating to misconduct in public office, as reported by CNN.

The arrest comes months after King Charles III stripped Andrew of his title as prince in October, amid renewed scrutiny following the release of additional Epstein-related documents by the US Department of Justice.

The King also initiated proceedings to remove Andrew from his residence at Windsor, where he had lived since 2003.

Reports earlier this month indicated that Andrew had relocated to Norfolk after the holiday season and was to be provided accommodation on the King’s private Sandringham estate, along with financial support, CNN reported.

At least seven British police forces–including London’s Metropolitan Police, Thames Valley Police, Norfolk Constabulary, Essex Police, Bedfordshire Police, West Midlands Police and Wiltshire Police–are said to be reviewing or assisting with enquiries related to disclosures in the Epstein files.

Get quick updates on major market movements, policy shifts, and financial developments shaping the economy of Nepal. Here are the key economic highlights for today:

Funding Gap Looms as Gen Z Protest Damage Tops Rs 84 Billion

The Ministry of Finance plans to spend Rs 4.34 billion this fiscal year to repair infrastructure damaged during the Gen Z protest. A report by the National Planning Commission estimates total physical property damage at Rs 84.457 billion, with public sector losses reaching Rs 44.937 billion. Over the next two years, the federal government anticipates spending Rs 10.18 billion annually on reconstruction. To bridge the funding gap, the ministry is seeking contributions from development partners and the Non-Resident Nepali (NRN) community while cutting costs on smaller projects.

Election Spending to Cross Rs 150 Billion

As the House of Representatives election approaches on March 5, economic activity is expected to reach Rs 150 billion. The government has managed Rs 30 billion for the polls, with Rs 10.39 billion for the Ministry of Home Affairs, Rs 6.72 billion for the Election Commission, and Rs 1.99 billion for the Ministry of Defense. Studies suggest candidates will spend over Rs 10 billion within official limits, though total informal spending could be much higher. While this provides a short-term boost to hotels, transport, and local businesses, experts warn of potential inflation and a temporary halt in long-term capital development.

Political Parties Pledge Energy Growth in Election Manifestos

Major political parties have identified energy as the backbone of national prosperity in their commitments for the March 5 election. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party proposed declaring the next decade as the Energy Production Decade, aiming for 28,500 megawatts by 2035. Similarly, the Ujyalo Nepal Party, led by Kulman Ghising, targets 12,000 megawatts by 2030 and 40,000 megawatts by 2045. They pledged to provide 1,000 shares of hydropower projects to every household and establish a People’s Hydropower Fund using 20% of project revenues to fund education, health, and employment initiatives, moving Nepal toward a carbon-neutral status.

Aviation Fuel Services Launch at Bharatpur Airport

The Nepal Oil Corporation Limited (NOC) officially launched aircraft refueling services at Bharatpur Airport on Wednesday. Executive Director Chandika Prasad Bhatta stated that the facility addresses the increasing flight frequency and passenger demand. The NOC established two refueling counters capable of providing 22,000 liters of fuel daily. Previously, aircraft had to carry extra fuel from Kathmandu, limiting passenger capacity. With six staff members deployed from the Sinamangal office, the new service allows airlines like Buddha Air to carry more passengers on flights between Bharatpur, Kathmandu, and Pokhara, enhancing regional air travel efficiency.

TIA Records Over 750K Monthly Passengers

Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) served 750,183 passengers in January, marking a significant increase from previous years. The TIA office reported 2,949 international and 6,809 domestic flights during the month. Specifically, 431,635 travelers used international services, while 318,548 flew on domestic routes. Currently, 29 international and 20 domestic airlines, including helicopters, operate at the airport. Among domestic carriers, the Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) carried 54,358 passengers, followed by Himalaya Airlines with 35,054 and Buddha Air with 2,834 on its international routes to India. The data reflects a steady recovery and growth in Nepal’s aviation sector compared to 2024 and 2025.

21 Depositors Claim Rs 11.21 Billion Embezzled by Cooperative

The Golden Times Saving and Credit Cooperative in Kamalpokhari allegedly defrauded 21 depositors of Rs 11.215 billion. Victims filed eight police complaints against the board of directors and management. Authorities arrested Chairman Rajendra Singh and Treasurer Amrita Bhattarai, while warrants are out for five others, including Executive Director Mamta Kumari Shivhare. The accused reportedly embezzled funds before closing the office and fleeing. Prosecutors are seeking up to 7 years in prison and fines of Rs 70,000 for those involved in the misappropriation of public savings.

Electricity Commission Researches Realistic Hydropower Costs

The Electricity Regulatory Commission is conducting a study to determine realistic construction and operational costs for hydropower projects. Led by Chairman Ram Prasad Dhital, the study covers run-of-river, peaking, and reservoir-type projects across the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali basins. The commission requested data from 484 private companies to establish a reference cost. This initiative aims to standardize Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rates and prevent cost manipulation, where some projects claim costs as high as Rs 450 million per megawatt. The findings will help investors and banks identify profitable projects and ensure transparent ownership transfers to the government after contract periods end.

Department Seizes 400 KG of Low-Quality Glucose

The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control halted operations at LG Glucose Packaging Industry in Chandragiri after finding 400 kilograms of low-quality glucose. The industry had been operating without government permission. Additionally, inspections at Darbar Cafe and Restaurant and Shiva Shankar Sweet and Chaat revealed severe hygiene violations, including the use of inedible artificial colors and ink-laden paper for food wrapping. Spokesperson Dr Balkumari Sharma warned that violating the Food Safety and Quality Act, 2024, carries fines up to Rs 500,000 and five years in prison. Authorities destroyed contaminated food and issued warnings to improve sanitation.

Nepal Simplifies Foreign Investment Via Automatic Route

The Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies updated the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act, 2019, to introduce an automatic route for approvals. Under the new regulations, there is no maximum limit for foreign investment in specified industries. Notably, for information technology-based industries, the government removed the minimum investment threshold entirely. This policy aims to reduce administrative hurdles and attract small- to medium-sized global investors into sectors like innovation, startups, and service industries. Officials believe the streamlined process will significantly decrease the time required for foreign companies to begin operations within the country.

Karnali Province Spends Only 16.14% of Total Budget

The Karnali Province government spent only 16.14% of its Rs 32.996 billion budget by mid-February. Provincial Accounts Controller Ratna Subedi reported that only Rs 5.324 billion was utilized, leaving Rs 27.67 billion unspent. Capital expenditure for development projects is particularly low at 9.44%, totaling Rs 1.88 billion. Despite instructions from Chief Minister Yamlal Kandel, procedural delays and the Gen Z protest have slowed progress. While administrative spending rose to 27.24%, the opposition Nepali Communist Party criticized the government for failing to implement development policies effectively.

Mechi Customs Office Collects Nearly Rs 10 Billion

The Mechi Customs Office in Jhapa collected Rs 9.922 billion in revenue during the first seven months of the current fiscal year. Information Officer Ishwar Kumar Humagain noted that while the overall target was Rs 10.552 billion, performance spiked in mid-January/mid-February. During that single month, the office collected Rs 1.513 billion, exceeding its monthly goal by 102.34%. The government aims to collect a total of Rs 18.877 billion from this office by the end of the fiscal year.

Suryabinayak-Dhulikhel Road Expansion Faces Rs 2 Billion Deficit

The Suryabinayak-Dhulikhel Road Project is facing a budget shortage, threatening the completion of the 15.8-kilometer expansion. Project Engineer Bishnu Prasad Khanal stated that while Rs 700 million was allocated this year, an additional Rs 2 billion is needed to pay contractors and finish blacktopping by July 16, 2025. The Suryabinayak-Sanga section is 48% complete under a Rs 3.889 billion contract, while the Sanga-Dhulikhel segment has reached 65% progress. Although the Ministry of Finance promised that work would not stop due to funds, delays in bridge construction remain a concern as designs for two major bridges are still being revised.

Gold Price Increases by Rs 4,300 Per Tola Today

The price of gold increased in the market on Thursday. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, the price of gold has increased by Rs 4,300 per tola (11.66 grams) today and is being traded at Rs 304,700.

Speaking on the last day of an IEA ministerial meeting in Paris, Wright said the 52-year-old agency should return to its founding mission of ensuring energy security.

The IEA was created to coordinate responses to major disruptions of supplies after the 1973 oil crisis, but Wright complained that it has adopted a climate agenda that includes the goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050.

“The US will use all the pressure we have to get the IEA to eventually, in the next year or so, move away from this agenda,” Wright said in a news conference.

“But if the IEA is not able to bring itself back to focusing on the mission of energy honesty, energy access and energy security, then sadly we would become an ex-member of the IEA,” he added.","{'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/direct-flight.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cloudy-day.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/f7201d0b-1846-4150-ae66-a8ff89b7c482.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/kric-rites.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/air-quality.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Accident-2.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Narayan-Prasad-Dahal.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gyanendra-shaha.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YADAV.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gold.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Nepal-news-white.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/change.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/sushila-2.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ramprasad-bhandari.jpeg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/KRB_KTM_PRAJATANTRA_DIWAS__U3A0775.jpggggggggggggggggggggggggg.jpg'}","पेरिस : अमेरिकी ऊर्जा सचिव क्रिस राइट न॑ गुरुवार क॑ अंतर्राष्ट्रीय ऊर्जा एजेंसी स॑ बाहर निकलै के धमकी क॑ नवीनीकरण करतें हुअ॑ कहलकै कि वाशिंगटन संगठन प॑ दबाव डालतै कि वू “अगिला साल या एकरा स॑ भी अधिक समय म॑” नेट-जीरो एजेंडा क॑ छोड़ी दै ।

Speaking on the 76th Democracy Day celebrations at the Nepali Army Pavilion in Kathmandu, she said democracy must deliver results, protect citizens' rights and ensure accountability.

Referring to the Gen Z-led protests in September last year that led to the ouster of K P Sharma Oli-led coalition government, Karki said, ""That movement sought an end to corruption, nepotism and discrimination. It sought good governance and equitable justice."" ""The state must respond to this not only with generosity, but also with humility and a deep sense of duty,"" she added.

She warned that failing to address youth discontent could trigger another rebellion.

""No nation can progress by undermining the youth,"" Karki, who became interim prime minister on September 12 last year, said.

""The youth have energy, aspiration for change and moral anger,"" she said, adding democracy is ""not only a process, but a result-oriented system"".

""We embraced democracy in principle, yet in practice, we continued to foster discrimination. We wrote equality in the Constitution; yet within our structures, we went on protecting inequality,"" she said.

Monopoly over power and resources has eroded public trust, fuelling rebellion, Karki added.

Separately, Nepal President Ramchandra Paudel expressed his wish that Democracy Day may help achieve national goals of sustainable peace, good governance, development and prosperity in the country.

President Paudel said that Nepalese people should never forget the 1950 revolution as it was an important foundation for the establishment of the federal democratic republic.

Democracy was established in Nepal through the 1950 revolution that ended the 104-year-old hereditary rule by Rana prime ministers reducing the king to a titular head.

""Democracy Day perpetuates the importance of civil rights and also always reminds us of the immortal story of the martyrs,"" the president said.

Meanwhile, former King Gyanendra has said that ""if we go for election without addressing the national crisis, it could invite more conflict"". He did not elaborate specifically what he meant by national crisis.

""The entire country has plunged into an unnatural crisis and the people are experiencing threat to the sovereignty of the country,"" claimed the former monarch in a video message broadcast on the National Democracy Day.

Gyanendra was indirectly hinting towards restoration of monarchy ahead of the March 5 general election which is evident from the voices raised by different pro-monarchist groups.

""We have to evaluate what we have gained from past movements and changes,"" Gyanendra said.

Nepal is set to hold the House of Representatives elections on March 5, the first since last year's deadly Gen-Z protests that toppled the K P Sharma Oli-led coalition government.","{'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2026-02/19/full/1771503410-6776.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27336%27%20height=%27188%27/%3e', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2026-02/03/full/1770094304-9035.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,size=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-04/04/full/1743751971-9646.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,size=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2026-02/19/full/1771479553-2592.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,size=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/menu/icons/1743085395.png', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-05/11/full/1746986639-4526.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/menu/icons/1743085430.png', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2023-04/06/full/1680770125-6097.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,size=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/menu/icons1743084979.png', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-05/23/full/1747967069-4267.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'https://www.business-standard.com/assets/web-assets/icons/user-profile.svg', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/menu/icons/1743085412.png', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/menu/icons/1743085376.png', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2026-02/19/full/1771508214-3298.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-09/15/full/1757930024-9646.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(382,233)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-10/18/full/1760775322-6843.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-09/15/thumb/fitandfill/1200X630/1757930024-9646.jpg', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-10/17/full/1760689121-5382.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(336,188)', 'https://www.business-standard.com/assets/web-assets/images/logo-bs.jpg', 'https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/include/_mod/site/html5/images/business-standard.png', 'https://www.business-standard.com/assets/web-assets/icons/notification.svg', 'https://www.business-standard.com/assets/web-assets/icons/search.svg'}","नेपालक अन्तरिम प्रधानमन्त्री सुशीला कार्की बृहस्पतिदिन चेतावनी देलनि अछि जे युवा असंतोषक समाधान नहि भेला सँ फेर विद्रोह भऽ सकैत अछि ।

One common thread runs through the entire exhibition: education as the turning point to break the cycle of poverty. About Mayaa World Mayaa World is an NGO founded in 2011 by Nicole Sicard and Sarbendra Pachhai. Its mission: to support children and families living in extreme poverty so that children can go to school and stay in school, in order to break the cycle of poverty. In Hong Kong, where poverty also affects the youngest (20% of the under-15 population lived below the poverty line in 2024*), Mayaa supports students in the most underprivileged areas by covering essential education-related expenses (uniforms, supplies, school and medical costs). In Nepal, Mayaa funds schooling and combines social follow-up, health and prevention programmes. A human-scale NGO, Mayaa relies on a largely volunteer team in Hong Kong and a salaried team in Nepal. * “Hong Kong Poverty Report 2024” — Oxfam Motto: “Offer a meal to a child and you give them a smile. Offer an EDUCATION and you give them a FUTURE.” About the photographer: Sophie Bonnin-Rocher Sophie Bonnin-Rocher is a photographer whose work draws on visual storytelling to highlight the value of people and create connection. Her practice ranges from documentary to portraiture, with a particular focus on impact-driven initiatives. For Where Hope Begins, Sophie first immersed herself in Mayaa World’s work to understand the essence of the project, the organisation’s long-term relationships with families in Hong Kong and Nepal, and the practical realities shaping children’s access to education. This led her to choose to document the children in their homes. The spaces where homework is done, where challenges are lived, and where resilience takes shape. Thanks to the trust built over years by Mayaa’s team, school directors and social workers, the families agreed to open their doors. Accompanied by members of the organisation, Sophie aimed to create a climate of ease that allowed her to capture moments that felt truthful, images the families themselves would recognise and feel comfortable seeing. “My work is often marked by enthusiasm, warmth and visible joy. Yet here, I was entering spaces shaped by hardship. My intention was to portray dignity, resilience and hope without inviting pity, which is at the heart of Mayaa’s work. To connect rather than dramatise, and to honour the trust of families who opened their homes to me. These images are the result of genuine encounters. I hope they reflect both the complexity of each story and the strength made possible by Mayaa’s long-term support in encouraging education and providing emotional guidance.”","{'https://lepetitjournal.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbackoffice.lepetitjournal.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F%25E2%2580%259CWHERE%2520HOPE%2520BEGINS%25E2%2580%259D.jpg&w=1200&q=75', 'https://lepetitjournal.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbackoffice.lepetitjournal.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2F%25E2%2580%259CWHERE%2520HOPE%2520BEGINS%25E2%2580%259D.jpg&w=1920&q=75', 'https://backoffice.lepetitjournal.com/sites/default/files/%E2%80%9CWHERE%20HOPE%20BEGINS%E2%80%9D.jpg', 'https://lepetitjournal.com/_next/image?url=%2Flogo-radio.png&w=3840&q=75'}","प्रदर्शनी के बारे म॑ “आशा कहाँ स॑ शुरू होय छै” म॑ सोफी बोनिन-रोचर द्वारा लेलऽ गेलऽ फोटो के चयन क॑ माया द्वारा समर्थित समुदायऽ के भीतर एक साथ लानलऽ गेलऽ छै । ई धारावाहिक दैनिक जीवन के दृश्य, स्कूल के क्षण, चित्र आरू शांत रोजमर्रा के क्षण के बारी-बारी स॑ प्रस्तुत करै छै । बिम्ब एकल कथा कहैत अछि-बिना सनसनीखेजताक-आ जेकरा हम सभ सेहो बहुत कम देखैत छी, ओकरा दृश्यमान बना दैत अछि। गवाही दै स॑ परे ई प्रदर्शनी के उद्देश्य संबंध पैदा करना छै: हांगकांग के बीच, जहां माया विपन्न बच्चा सिनी क॑ भी सहायता दै छै, आरू नेपाल, जहां माया एक दशक स॑ भी अधिक समय स॑ परिवारऽ के सहायता करी रहलऽ छै । एकटा साझा धागा पूरा प्रदर्शनी मे चलैत अछि : गरीबी के चक्र के तोड़य के मोड़ के रूप मे शिक्षा. माया वर्ल्ड के बारे में माया वर्ल्ड एकटा गैर सरकारी संगठन अछि जेकर स्थापना 2011 में निकोल सिकार्ड आ सरबेन्द्र पचाई केने छलाह | एकर मिशन: अत्यधिक गरीबी मे रहय वाला बच्चाक आ परिवारक कें सहायता करनाय ताकि बच्चाक स्कूल जा सकय आ स्कूल मे रह सकय, ताकि गरीबी कें चक्र कें तोड़ल जा सकय. हांगकांग मे, जत गरीबी सब सं कम उम्र कें लोगक कें सेहो प्रभावित करएयत छै (2024 मे 15 साल सं कम उम्र कें आबादी कें 20% गरीबी रेखा सं नीचा रहएयत छल*), माया शिक्षा सं संबंधित आवश्यक खर्चक (वर्दी, आपूर्ति, स्कूल आ चिकित्सा लागत) कें कवर कयर सब सं विपन्न क्षेत्रक मे छात्रक कें सहायता करएयत छै. नेपाल मे माया स्कूली शिक्षा कें वित्तपोषण आ सामाजिक अनुवर्ती, स्वास्थ्य आ रोकथाम कार्यक्रमक कें संयोजन करएयत छै. मानव पैमाना पर बनल गैर सरकारी संगठन माया हांगकांग मे बहुत हद तक स्वयंसेवी टीम आ नेपाल मे वेतनभोगी टीम पर निर्भर अछि । * “हांगकांग गरीबी रिपोर्ट 2024” — ऑक्सफैम आदर्श वाक्य: “एकटा बच्चा के भोजन के ऑफर दियौ आ अहाँ ओकरा मुस्कान दैत छी। EDUCATION ऑफर करू आ अहाँ ओकरा FUTURE दियौ।” फोटोग्राफर के बारे में : सोफी बोनिन-रोचर सोफी बोनिन-रोचर एक फोटोग्राफर छै जेकरऽ काम दृश्य कहानी के आधार पर लोगऽ के मूल्य क॑ उजागर करै आरू कनेक्शन पैदा करै छै । हुनकऽ अभ्यास डॉक्यूमेंट्री स॑ ल॑ क॑ चित्रकला तक के छै, जेकरा म॑ विशेष रूप स॑ प्रभाव संचालित पहल प॑ ध्यान देलऽ गेलऽ छै । आशा कहाँ स॑ शुरू होय छै लेली सोफी न॑ सबसें पहल॑ ई परियोजना केरऽ सार, हांगकांग आरू नेपाल केरऽ परिवारऽ के साथ संगठन केरऽ दीर्घकालिक संबंध, आरू बच्चा सिनी के शिक्षा तक पहुँच क॑ आकार दै वाला व्यावहारिक वास्तविकता क॑ समझै लेली माया वर्ल्ड केरऽ काम म॑ डूबी गेलै । एहि सं ओ बच्चा सभ के घर मे दस्तावेजीकरण करय के फैसला केलनि. ओ जगह जतय होमवर्क कैल जायत छै, जतय चुनौती कें जील जायत छै, आ जतय लचीलापन आकार लैत छै. माया के टीम, स्कूल डायरेक्टर आओर समाजसेवी के सालों सं बनल ट्रस्ट के बदौलत परिवार सभ अपन दरवाजा खोलय लेल तैयार भ गेल. संगठन के सदस्यऽ के साथ सोफी के उद्देश्य छेलै कि सहजता के माहौल पैदा करलऽ जाय जेकरा स॑ वू ऐन्हऽ क्षण क॑ कैप्चर करी सक॑ जे सच्चा लगै, छवि क॑ परिवार खुद पहचानी लेतै आरू देखै म॑ सहज महसूस करतै । ""हमरऽ काम म॑ अक्सर उत्साह, गर्मजोशी आरू दृश्यमान आनन्द के चिन्हित करलऽ जाय छै । तभियो यहाँ हम्में कठिनाई के आकार के जगहऽ म॑ प्रवेश करी रहलऽ छेलियै ।हमरऽ इरादा छेलै कि बिना दया के आमंत्रित करलऽ मर्यादा, लचीलापन आरू आशा के चित्रण करलऽ जाय, जे माया के काम के मूल में छै । नाटकीयता के बजाय जोड़ना, आरू हमरा लेली अपनऽ घर खोलै वाला परिवारऽ के भरोसा के सम्मान करना ।ई छवि असली के परिणाम छेकै मुठभेड़ मे आशा अछि जे एहि मे प्रत्येक कथाक जटिलता आ... शिक्षा क॑ प्रोत्साहित करै आरू भावनात्मक मार्गदर्शन दै म॑ माया केरऽ दीर्घकालिक सहयोग स॑ जे ताकत संभव होय गेलऽ छै ।”"

Nepali Congress (NC) President Gagan Kumar Thapa has described the period from 2046 BS to 2051 BS-when the party led successive governments-as a ""golden era"" in Nepal's political history.

Speaking at an open question-and-answer session on Thursday during the launch of the party's commitment letter for the upcoming House of Representatives (HoR) election, President Thapa stated that many of the country's enduring economic achievements stem from the reforms introduced during that period. According to him, the foundations of Nepal's present economic development were laid between 2046 BS and 2051 BS, when the NC initiated significant economic reforms.

NC President Thapa further remarked that the nation must now chart a clear course toward greater economic prosperity.

Thapa also maintained that a review of Nepal's major public policies reveals that they were largely shaped by reforms implemented under NC leadership. He recalled that party stalwarts, including BP Koirala, were visionary leaders who formulated policies with a long-term perspective, looking three decades ahead.

""We will continue to highlight our glorious history and achievements,"" he said, adding that the party would also revisit its past struggles. He emphasised that the NC possesses a clear vision and roadmap for ensuring economic progress and prosperity over the next 30 years.","{'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46060.JPG&w=30&q=100&f=jpg', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_x.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/logo-100.png', 'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46047.jpg&w=30&q=100&f=jpg', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_whatsapp.png', 'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46064.jpg&w=30&q=100&f=jpg', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46060.JPG', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_instagram.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_viber.png', 'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46053.jpeg&w=30&q=100&f=jpg', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_telegram.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_pinterest.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_linkedin.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_messenger.png', 'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46045.jpg&w=30&q=100&f=jpg', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_facebook.png', 'https://thehimalayantimes.com/theme_himalayantimes/images/layout/icon_youtube.png', 'https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/thehimalayantimes/uploads/images/2026/02/19/46046.jpg&w=30&q=100&f=jpg'}","काठमाण्डू, 19 फरवरी

- Rescuers and veteran climbers back reforms designed to stop underprepared adventurers from turning Everest into a deadly bottleneck

KATHMANDU, Nepal

At nearly 8,400 meters (over 27,500 feet) above sea level, in the thin, unforgiving air of Mt. Everest’s “death zone,” Indian climbers Chetna Sahoo and her husband Pradip hovered between life and death.

Their supplemental oxygen cylinders were empty, their hands and feet severely frostbitten, and both had lost consciousness, unable to descend from the mountain’s upper slopes.

This was the spring climbing season of 2016, and had a team of Sherpa rescuers not intervened, the couple would likely have perished high on Everest.

Driven by a long-held ambition to stand atop the world’s highest peak, the pair had paid an expedition agency to guide them to the summit despite lacking sufficient high-altitude experience.

Their struggle not only endangered their own lives but also threatened others, as they blocked fixed climbing ropes along narrow ridges used by descending climbers.

“We, along with their guide Phurba, helped bring them down to Camp II, where helicopter rescue is possible, and they were airlifted to the mountain’s base,” Lakpa Sherpa, one of the rescuers, recalled in a conversation with Anadolu.

Recalling their condition, he added: “I have seen hundreds of such scenes on Everest, if not thousands.”

Lakpa, who now runs an expedition agency, says a growing number of aspiring climbers believe Everest can be conquered with money alone. Some climbers seek sponsorships, hire low-cost expedition operators and attempt Everest directly from sea level.

Nepal is moving to address this influx of inexperienced climbers, which authorities say has led to overcrowding and safety risks, among other problems.

A proposal to ban climbers lacking experience on a 7,000-meter (22,965 feet) peak in Nepal was passed by the parliament’s upper house this week, and the lower chamber is also expected to vote it through before the March 5 elections.

When ambition turns deadly

Since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay first summited Everest in 1953, no formal rule has barred individuals from attempting the climb.

Anyone able to pay royalties, agency fees and personal expenses can obtain a permit.

Under this system, even inexperienced climbers can attempt Everest. Some arrive without knowing how to properly use equipment or acclimatize to altitude, problems that become critical in the mountain’s thin air.

According to rescuers, the Sahoo couple had previously turned back after avalanches and earthquakes disrupted attempts to reach base camp. Their eventual ascent brought them into the death zone – and into grave danger.

They were fortunate to encounter rescuers, but not all climbers are as lucky. “Climbing Everest on the first attempt isn’t an easy task,” Lakpa said. “You need solid climbing experience before attempting it. People need to realize that life is more important than climbing a mountain.”

Several deaths on the peak have been linked to prolonged waits at extreme altitude, with many victims trapped in the death zone for hours due to traffic jams near the summit.

In 2019, for instance, 11 climbers died on Everest, even though there were no major disasters such as avalanches or storms.

The tragedies sparked global criticism and prompted questions about Nepal’s regulation of climbing expeditions. International media pressed then-Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on the government’s failure to manage overcrowding and safety risks.

Mountaineering safety became a national political issue. Lawmakers raised concerns in parliament, and legal petitions called for regulation of the growing number of climbers.

Under mounting pressure, the government formed a study panel comprising tourism officials, expedition organizers and mountaineering experts. The team identified multiple safety issues and recommended barring climbers without experience on peaks of at least 7,000 meters.

Industry welcomes regulations

For years, those recommendations remained unimplemented. Now, nearly eight years after the initial calls for reform, Nepal has moved to regulate Everest expeditions.

This week, the National Assembly approved Tourism Bill 2081, aimed at overhauling the climbing industry. Officials involved in drafting the legislation say barring inexperienced climbers could reduce fatalities on the world’s highest mountain.

The proposed law would also require recent medical reports from climbers before permits are issued.

Another change is that Nepal’s Tourism Department would now officially determine fatalities on the mountain, and expedition agencies – long accused of abandoning bodies and listing climbers as missing – would be held accountable for retrieving bodies from high altitude.

The bill also proposes environmental fees to fund cleanup efforts and support Sherpa communities.

Regarding the timeframe for its enforcement, Himal Gautam, a director at the Tourism Department, said: “Let’s see how fast the process moves. Based on the act, new regulations must be drafted and enacted, so it will take some time.”

Tourism entrepreneurs, guides and veteran climbers have broadly welcomed the move to restrict inexperienced climbers.

“It’s good for the climbing industry,” said Lal Bahadur Jirel, who suffered severe frostbite during the 2019 summit traffic jam. “This will also help diversify climbing to other parts of the country where many smaller mountains remain unclimbed.”

Last August, to promote alternative destinations, Nepal’s Tourism Department opened 97 mountains for free climbing permits for two years. The government has also increased climbing royalties to $15,000 per foreign climber beginning this spring season, aiming to reduce overcrowding.

For rescuers like Lakpa, Everest remains both a place of triumph and tragedy – where ambition meets reality, and where experience can mean the difference between life and death.

“If mountain tourism is to be sustainable, the government must enforce these measures soon,” Lakpa said.

बढ़ैत दबाव मे सरकार एकटा अध्ययन पैनल के गठन केलक जाहि मे पर्यटन अधिकारी, अभियान आयोजक आ पर्वतारोहण विशेषज्ञ शामिल छल। टीम न॑ सुरक्षा केरऽ कई तरह के मुद्दा के पहचान करलकै आरू कम स॑ कम ७,००० मीटर के चोटी प॑ बिना अनुभव वाला पर्वतारोही क॑ रोकै के सिफारिश करलकै ।

उद्योग नियमक स्वागत करैत अछि

सालों स ओ सिफारिश अप्रभावित रहल। आब सुधार के प्रारंभिक आह्वान के लगभग आठ साल बाद नेपाल एवरेस्ट अभियान के नियंत्रित करय लेल आगू बढ़ल अछि.

एहि सप्ताह राष्ट्रीय सभा पर्यटन विधेयक 2081 कए मंजूरी द देलक, जेकर उद्देश्य पर्वतारोही उद्योग कए ओवरहाल करब अछि। कानून केरऽ मसौदा तैयार करै म॑ शामिल अधिकारी सिनी के कहना छै कि अनुभवहीन पर्वतारोही क॑ रोकला स॑ दुनिया केरऽ सबस॑ ऊँचऽ पहाड़ प॑ जानलेवा घटना म॑ कमी ​​आबी सकै छै ।

प्रस्तावित कानून मे परमिट जारी करबा स पहिने पर्वतारोही स हाल क मेडिकल रिपोर्ट सेहो लेब जरूरी होएत।

एकटा आओर परिवर्तन ई अछि जे नेपालक पर्यटन विभाग आब आधिकारिक तौर पर पहाड़ पर जानलेवा घटनाक निर्धारण करत, आ अभियान एजेंसी – पर बहुत दिन सं लाश छोड़बाक आ पर्वतारोही कें लापता बताबय के आरोप – उच्च ऊँचाई सं लाश निकालबाक लेल जवाबदेह होयत.

एहि विधेयक मे सफाई क प्रयास कए फंडिंग आ शेर्पा समुदाय कए समर्थन करबा लेल पर्यावरण शुल्क क प्रस्ताव सेहो देल गेल अछि।

एकरऽ प्रवर्तन के समय सीमा के बारे म॑ पर्यटन विभाग केरऽ निदेशक हिमल गौतम न॑ कहलकै कि देखै ल॑ मिलै छै कि ई प्रक्रिया कतेक तेजी स॑ चलै छै ।

पर्यटन उद्यमी, गाइड आरू अनुभवी पर्वतारोही सिनी नँ अनुभवहीन पर्वतारोही सिनी क प्रतिबंधित करै के कदम के मोटा-मोटी स्वागत करलकै ।

2019 केरऽ शिखर सम्मेलन के जाम के दौरान भारी ठंढा के शिकार लाल बहादुर जिरेल न॑ कहलकै कि ई पर्वतारोही उद्योग लेली अच्छा छै । “ई देश केरऽ अन्य भागऽ म॑ चढ़ै म॑ भी विविधता लानै म॑ मदद करतै, जहां बहुत छोटऽ-छोटऽ पहाड़ऽ प॑ चढ़ाई नै होय रहलऽ छै ।”

पिछला अगस्त मे वैकल्पिक गंतव्य कए बढ़ावा देबा लेल नेपाल क पर्यटन विभाग दू साल लेल मुफ्त चढ़ाई क परमिट लेल 97टा पहाड़ खोललक। सरकार न॑ ई वसंत ऋतु स॑ शुरू होय क॑ क्लाइम्बिंग रॉयल्टी क॑ भी बढ़ा क॑ १५,००० डॉलर प्रति विदेशी पर्वतारोही करी देल॑ छै, जेकरऽ मकसद भीड़ क॑ कम करना छै ।

लकपा जैसनऽ उद्धारकर्ता लेली एवरेस्ट जीत आरू त्रासदी दूनू के जगह बनलऽ छै – जहाँ महत्वाकांक्षा वास्तविकता स॑ मिलै छै, आरू जहाँ अनुभव के मतलब जीवन आरू मृत्यु के बीच के अंतर होय सकै छै ।

लकपा कहलनि जे, पहाड़ी पर्यटन के टिकाऊ बनय के अछि त सरकार के ई उपाय जल्दिये लागू करय पड़त।

He added that the country must now determine its path towards greater economic prosperity.

He announced his departure from UML on February 2 and joined NC on February 17.

Switching between NC, Madhesh-centered parties, and UML has been normal for Dev. He has changed parties eight times so far. On 2 July 2023, he had left NC and returned to UML. At that time, he said, “Having been involved in leftist politics for a long time, I felt like returning to it in the later stage of my life.”

However, he did not remain long in UML. When he left UML, this time, on February 2, Dev raised serious questions about the role of party chairman KP Sharma Oli. He argued that he disagreed with the party’s ideology, policy, and conduct, saying it was being driven toward individualism and personality worship and being operated in an authoritarian and discriminatory manner. Previously, when he had rejoined UML, he had praised Chairman Oli for making the party powerful and confident. “I stayed outside UML for 17 years, and I regret that. But I learned many things while being outside. Now I pledge to unite UML and move forward,” Dev had said. “Make me not a leader, but a worker.”

After leaving the student federation in 1985, he became president of the Nepal National Youth Federation. During the Panchayat era, CPN (Manandhar group) later became CPN (Democratic) in the multi-party system. That party is now known as CPN (United).

Jitendra Narayan’s political journey began on 13 April 1973 with the CPN (Manandhar group) led by Bishnu Bahadur Manandhar. Eight years later, around 1981, he became acting president of the Nepal National Student Federation, the student wing of the CPN (Manandhar group). A year later, he was elected as president. After leaving the student federation in 1985, he became president of the Nepal National Youth Federation. During the Panchayat era, CPN (Manandhar group) later became CPN (Democratic) in the multi-party system. That party is now known as CPN (United).

Dev and his team from CPN (Democratic) joined UML on 5 December 1992. Although leaders and cadres including Dev entered UML under the leadership of Madan Thapa, only Sita Nandan Rai and Jitendra Narayan were appointed as central committee members that same day. When UML split on 5 March 1998, Dev joined CPN (ML). Later, on 15 February 2002, along with CPN (ML) General Secretary Bam Dev Gautam, he returned to UML.

He stated that his contributions were valued only by the Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum (Loktantrik) and the Nepali Congress. He served as General Secretary of the Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum (Loktantrik), which was formed after a split from the Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum. In the 2013 second Constituent Assembly, he was a proportional representation lawmaker from the Loktantrik Forum. Likewise, in 2017, NC made him a National Assembly member. During that period, he also served twice as a minister.

Dev and his team from CPN (Democratic) joined UML on 5 December 1992. Although leaders and cadres including Dev entered UML under the leadership of Madan Thapa, only Sita Nandan Rai and Jitendra Narayan were appointed as central committee members that same day.

After the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, he left UML and joined the Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum Nepal led by Upendra Yadav. In that election, UML was reduced to 33 seats under the first-past-the-post system but secured 70 seats under proportional representation. Although UML selected 13 lawmakers from the Madhesi community under proportional representation, Dev was not among them.

After UML did not make him a Constituent Assembly member, he joined the Forum just one month after the election. However, in 2007, when the Forum split and the Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum (Loktantrik) was formed, he joined that faction. In 2017, when the Loktantrik Forum merged with the Nepali Congress, Dev also entered NC which made him a National Assembly member in 2017.

After completing his term as a National Assembly member on 3 March 2024, Dev once again returned to UML. After Gagan Kumar Thapa became the President of NC through a special general convention, he is again attracted toward NC. He says, “I have entered Nepali Congress for good, abandoning communist politics, because I believe a renewed Nepali Congress will also transform the country. It will bring progressive and democratic transformation in the country’s economic and political sphere. I have also worked in Nepali Congress for six years in the past.”","{'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/direct-flight.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cloudy-day.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GAGAN-1.jpeg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/inbound5291609486004552309.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/change.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Banner_Photo-25.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GAGAN-3.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/RSP.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/oli-3.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/gold.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Nepal-news-white.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-19-at-2.50.44-PM.jpeg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ElectionCommission_Banner.jpg', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/photo-collage.png-2.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/air-quality.png', 'https://english.nepalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/close.png'}","पूर्वमन्त्री जितेन्द्र नारायण देव नेकपा छोड़लाक बाद एक मासक भीतर नेपाली कांग्रेसमे सम्मिलित भेल छथि । ओ 2 फरवरी कए एमाले स विदा हेबाक घोषणा केलथि आ 17 फरवरी कए नेकपा मे शामिल भ गेलाह।

"February 19: Nepal’s RSP Pledges Civil-Service Neutrality, Reform Mandate - Meyka","February 19: Nepal’s RSP Pledges Civil-Service Neutrality, Reform Mandate  Meyka",2026-02-19 19:56:58,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOdUg5a25HSnRhczRuay1RdUhyQWhrOFc0QUtsN0lTMXJhODZZUWxyMW5ZWHRjeElvZ3FKZlBWTlRrdzhGX2Izcjk5OGNCdXZyZHk1MnY0c2R1ZGFUYkxrVmUtQVdmbzNIZFZHaUhyRUVEOWxsQXlHbDJYdV8tTlJ5XzNtcjhnSjAzNjlwLVVySFBRdEIweW1pQ0ZVRjFpYTFS?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://meyka.com,Meyka,"On February 19, Nepal governance reform took center stage as the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) pledged to criminalize partisan loyalty for state-paid workers and push civil service neutrality. For Canadian investors, the pledge targets policy drift that inflates risk premiums and delays projects. If enacted, cleaner rules could support procurement integrity, steadier permits, and clearer timelines. We review what the proposal means, where the opportunities sit, and how to position portfolios exposed to foreign investment Nepal. We also flag key signals to watch before capital commits.

RSP’s pledge and institutional impact

RSP proposes to treat active party loyalty by state-paid workers as a punishable offense, backed by clearer codes and oversight source. This aims to reduce political orders inside ministries and speed routine approvals. For investors, such Nepal governance reform would narrow discretion risks in licensing, taxes, and inspections. Delivery still depends on draft language, prosecutorial capacity, and court timelines, so we watch whether penalties target behavior, not speech, and how whistleblower protection appears.

RSP also wants party-linked “sister organizations” out of state workplaces. Removing parallel political channels could make tender committees and personnel offices answer to formal rules, not party emissaries. That strengthens civil service neutrality, advances Nepal governance reform, and may cut informal fees. For investors assessing foreign investment Nepal, fewer extra sign-offs can shave weeks from contracting. We will track if ministries publish conflict registers and committee minutes to verify the change. Lamichhane’s appeal to reject parties supports this push source.

Why it matters for Canadian capital

For Canadian funds, credible Nepal governance reform could trim political risk spreads and reduce contingency buffers in budgets. When approvals follow rules, lenders cut delay allowances, which improves debt capacity. Cleaner procurement also helps EPC contractors price bids with less slack. In Canada, that can make Nepal allocations compete better with Southeast Asia in infrastructure or hydropower mandates, without raising portfolio risk beyond policy limits.

We see near-term interest from Canadian hydropower developers, transmission suppliers, and risk-sharing lenders. Tourism and digital services could follow if visas, tax rulings, and land clearances gain predictability tied to Nepal governance reform. Pension and insurance allocators may test co-investments alongside MDBs. For foreign investment Nepal, watch cross-border power trade with India, because bankable offtake agreements are the anchor for project finance and determine whether CAD exposure can be hedged efficiently.

Procurement and compliance watchpoints

Investors should look for standardized bidding documents, ranked criteria, and digital audit trails. If Nepal governance reform delivers that, bid protests fall and completion rates rise. Banks then lower loan pricing tied to execution risk. In Canada, that can shift hurdle rates for Nepal projects closer to ASEAN benchmarks, subject to stable FX access and predictable repatriation for dividends and fees under existing regulations.

Until rules change on paper and in practice, we advise enhanced due diligence on local partners and agents. Map political exposure, media history, and court cases. Align internal controls to civil service neutrality standards and document interactions. Consider political risk insurance for transfer and expropriation coverage. For foreign investment Nepal, keep escalation pathways precise, including arbitration venues and governing law acceptable to Canadian lenders.

Signals and timelines to track

Key signals include a bill criminalizing partisan loyalty tabled with clear definitions, cabinet directives to end sister bodies in ministries, and an updated civil service code with independent oversight. We also watch publication of procurement dashboards and case outcomes. If these steps arrive in sequence, Nepal governance reform gains credibility, and investors can move from pilot studies to term sheets with greater confidence.

Beyond laws, we track multilateral lending pipelines, sovereign outlook notes, and cross-border energy deals as Nepal governance reform advances. Signals here affect pricing and flows into Nepal ETFs or frontier allocations. If risk premia tighten, Canadian managers can extend duration on Nepal-linked debt or expand project finance sleeves. If progress stalls, we keep exposure modest, focus on short tenors, and require strong guarantees.

Final Thoughts

RSP’s pledges are political signals, not policy yet. For Canadian investors, the smart move is to prepare, verify, and phase in capital as facts emerge. Start by mapping exposure to permits, procurement steps, and courts. Define what proof of Nepal governance reform you require: a tabled bill, an updated civil service code, transparent tender data, and early case rulings. Align partner vetting with civil service neutrality and document every state touchpoint. Price scenarios for both progress and delay, and pre-clear political risk insurance. Track power offtake agreements and multilateral pipelines that can anchor cash flows. When milestones hit, widen bids and extend tenors. If momentum fades, limit exposure and use shorter contracts. This keeps risk controlled while preserving upside if Nepal’s institutions strengthen. Coordinate with Canadian lenders on governing law and collateral structures suitable for Nepal. Maintain regular engagement with chambers of commerce in Kathmandu and Ottawa for policy updates.

FAQs

What did Nepal’s RSP pledge on February 19? Rastriya Swatantra Party vowed to criminalize partisan loyalty among state-paid workers, end party “sister organizations” in state spaces, and promote civil service neutrality. The aim is to depoliticize decisions and procurement. For investors, fewer discretionary delays could lower risk premiums, improve project timelines, and support bankable deals if laws and enforcement follow.

How could this affect Canadian investors? Cleaner rules can cut delay buffers in budgets, raise completion rates, and widen access to debt. Canadian developers, suppliers, and funds may find better pricing in hydropower and infrastructure if procurement and permits become transparent. Any exposure should phase in, with due diligence, risk insurance, and clear investment triggers tied to legal milestones and early enforcement.

Which signals show reforms are real? Look for a bill defining punishable partisan conduct, cabinet directives removing sister bodies from ministries, and an updated civil service code. Seek procurement dashboards, published committee minutes, and early court rulings. Also track multilateral lending pipelines and power offtake agreements with India that can anchor finance as reforms progress from pledges into practice.

What risks remain even if reforms pass? Implementation can be uneven across agencies. Enforcement might target opponents rather than practices, creating new uncertainties. Procurement could improve slower than hoped. Currency access and repatriation sit outside governance pledges. Maintain conservative assumptions, shorter tenors initially, strong guarantees, and thorough documentation aligned to civil service neutrality to manage downside while preserving optionality.","{'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/advertise-banner-tablet.svg', 'https://blog-meyka-wordpress.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/featured_image-9394.png', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-api-banner-desktop.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-api-banner-large-desktop.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/advertise-banner-mobile-compact.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-banner-tablet.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-api-banner-tablet.svg', 'https://meyka.com/_next/image/?url=%2Fwhitelogo.png&w=64&q=30', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-api-banner-mobile.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-banner-desktop.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-banner-large-desktop.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/meyka-banner-mobile-compact.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/advertise-banner-large-desktop.svg', 'https://meyka.com/banner-images/svg-banner/advertise-banner-desktop.svg'}","19 फरवरी कए नेपाल शासन सुधार केंद्र मंच पर आबि गेल छल, किया कि राष्ट्रीय स्वतंत्र पार्टी राज्य वेतनभोगी मजदूर क पक्षपातपूर्ण निष्ठा कए अपराध मानलक आ सिविल सेवा तटस्थता कए आगू बढ़ेबाक वचन देलक। कनाडा के निवेशक के लेल ई प्रतिज्ञा नीतिगत बहाव के लक्षित करैत अछि जे जोखिम प्रीमियम के फुलाबैत अछि आ परियोजना में देरी करैत अछि. अगर कानून बनायल जायत त स्वच्छ नियम खरीद अखंडता, स्थिर परमिट, आ स्पष्ट समय सीमा के समर्थन क सकैत अछि. हम समीक्षा करैत छी जे प्रस्ताव के की मतलब अछि, अवसर कतय बैसल अछि, आ विदेशी निवेश नेपाल के सामना करय वाला पोर्टफोलियो के कोना पोजीशन देल जाय. हम पूंजी कमिट सं पहिने देखय लेल कुंजी संकेत सेहो फ्लैग करैत छी.

The books are namely 'Bipana Katipaya,' and 'Kathastha' two outsanding anthology of stories by the Darjeeling-based veteran writer late Indra Bahadur Rai, and 'Baikuntha Express,' a play book by the late Mohan Raj Sharma.

All three books had long been out of print, leaving bibliophiles eagerly searching for copies.

""These books were loved very much by the readers in the past,"" Ramesh Ghorsaine, properieter of the newly established publication house, said, ""However, the must-read books were not available in the market. That is why we decided to republish them.""

'Bipana Katipaya' features some of Rai’s most popular, lucid, and accessible short stories. Timeless pieces such as 'Jayamaya Eklai Likhapan Aaipugi,' 'Meri Didi,' 'Jaar: Bhaekai Euta Katha,' 'Chaparasi,' and 'Jagat Ra Sabitriko Dukhanta Katha' poignantly portray the struggles and sorrows of ordinary people. Notably, Sikkim-based filmmaker Phurba Tshering Lama adapted Rai’s story 'Jaar' into a feature film of the same title. 'Kaptan Raghubir Barma,' 'Ichchha Bachirahanchha', 'Andhyara Drishtiharuko Chorus' and others are also worth reading. The book comprises 23 short stories.

Similarly, 'Kathastha' contains 13 experimental stories grounded in the literary theory of Tesro Aayam (The Third Dimension). Tesro Aayam was a significant literary movement led by Rai, the late poet Ishwar Ballav, and poet and Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila. Stories such as 'Khir,' 'Euta Dinko Samanyata,' and 'Blackout, Kaju Badam, Chhora' stand out as some of the most acclaimed works in this collection.

'Baikuntha Express,' first published in 2042 BS, is an experimental play and remains the only drama to have won the prestigious Madan Prize in that year. ""This is one of the finest works by writer Sharma,"" notes writer Avinash Shrestha in the book’s blurb. ""Although it is regarded as one of the best Nepali plays ever written, theatre directors in Nepal have rarely dared to stage it.""

The former two were previously published by Darjeeling-based Shyam Brothers, while the third was earlier brought out by Sajha Prakashan.

In addition, the Imprint Publishers has brought out new anthology of long stories by Govinda Giri Prerana. With the slogan of 'Turning pages, changing minds,' the publishing house is planning to bring out all the noted classic Nepali books as well as new and promising ones.

""We do not want the gems of Nepali literature to fade into oblivion,"" proprietor Ghorsaine said. ""At the same time, we aim to offer readers a fresh and distinctive literary taste by bringing out new ones.""","{'https://risingnepaldaily.com/commons/rising-logo.png', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96706/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96710/conversions/edtoril-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96707/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96712/conversions/Untitled-1-square-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96708/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96712/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96713/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96709/Untitled-1.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96707/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96710/conversions/edtoril-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96705/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/commons/placeholders/original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/96706/conversions/Untitled-1-original-thumb.jpg', 'https://risingnepaldaily.com/storage/media/885/conversions/square-thumb-thumb-thumb.jpg'}","एक स्टाफ रिपोर्टर, काठमांडू, २० फरवरी : इम्प्रिंट पब्लिशर्स न॑ कुछ सबसें प्रसिद्ध क्लासिक नेपाली कथा-साहित्य क॑ सामने लानल॑ छै । पुस्तकऽ के नाम छै ‘बिपाना कटिपया,’ आरू ‘कथास्थ’ दार्जिलिंग के दिग्गज साहित्यकार स्वर्गीय इंद्र बहादुर राय के दू उत्कृष्ट कहानी संकलन, आरू स्वर्गीय मोहन राज शर्मा के नाटक पुस्तक ‘बैकुंठा एक्सप्रेस’ ।

"Youth and members of civil society question exclusionary systems, call for democratic reform in Nepal - kathmandupost.com","Youth and members of civil society question exclusionary systems, call for democratic reform in Nepal  kathmandupost.com",2026-02-20 01:11:05,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi3wFBVV95cUxOU2NlTmlkNm9YMVp1c211ZUphTC1neFVUYTVmakZXNEhZcGpYX1lESVM0YzVnNzJ3VzR6YkN6NTRmMU9KWFFfOTdCV0pZSWRuN3NvTzRnRm4tUC1zXzhqUzlPcFpHbW1DNU5hZi1KOVc4QUFsLTdxSmRTUmdsU3VaWkpUWDJpMzNNd29Ea2g1OG5hanhJYXFGYUZYY2lyTEptanJ1UkZ6RkplY0tQY1RpWGw2QkFNaWk0d05FOGVUYjVqM081MHh3SmJUT2N4YUNNa3VUYUtMZVpmTEozVVp3?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://kathmandupost.com,kathmandupost.com,"Civil society leaders, youth representatives and community advocates have called for stronger inclusion and accountability in Nepal’s democratic system, saying structural barriers continue to shape who participates in politics and who remains excluded.

Speaking at a public dialogue titled ‘Samabesita Sambad: A National Dialogue on Inclusive Democracy’, panellists said that while youth engagement is growing, political participation and representation remain uneven, particularly for historically marginalised groups.

The one-day symposium was organised by the Ujyaalo Foundation with support from the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives and in partnership with Nepal Mahila Ekata Samaj, Dalit with Disabilities Association Nepal, Kalpa Empower Women Nepal, Accountability Lab Nepal, Project Abhaya and Days for Girls Nepal. More than 100 participants attended the programme in Kathmandu.

The panel discussion highlighted a gap between constitutional rights and everyday realities, noting that young people and marginalised communities are often expected to be seen and not heard in academic institutions and political parties. Speakers said this reflects systemic barriers rather than a lack of capability.

The symposium featured three thematic plenary sessions, each lasting nearly one and a half hours, allowing panellists and participants to engage in extended discussions on political representation, merit and access.

The first panel, ‘Missing Voices, Broken Mandates,’ examined structural barriers in political representation. Shailee Chaudhary, a human rights advocate and proportional list candidate from Gatisheel Loktrantik Party, linked these challenges to the “Brahmanical patriarchal system, a mindset practised for 3,000 years.” She questioned who benefits from quotas: “Is it those with social, financial, and political capital, or someone who lacks basic access?”

Adding to this, Krishna Gahatraj, an expert in disability-inclusive development, brought lived experience, sharing it took him 15 years to realise his societal placement was due to caste. “Even today, a Dalit has a hard time finding a room to rent in Kathmandu,” he said. “This is not just a reaction; it is living pain.”

The second panel shifted focus to the very meaning of representation itself, with speakers challenging conventional notions of merit and demanding a fundamental redesign of political access.

Monika, a queer intersectional feminist and member of the GenZ Movement Alliance, argued that until there is reparative representation, “there is no fair competition on unequal footing.” She offered a compelling example to illustrate her point, comparing political design to universal design: ‘‘If every bus is designed in an accessible way for people with disabilities, it can still be of use to able-bodied people. Why can’t the design be made universal? Can’t policies be made by keeping historically marginalised groups at the centre?’’

She concluded by stating, ‘‘We certainly hold the right to vote, but we should also have the right to see ourselves as an election candidate.""

Meanwhile, Man Bahadur BK, former government secretary, presented an assessment of the country’s trajectory in ensuring inclusion for marginalised groups. ‘‘There is limited freedom of choice among elected lawmakers in expressing their viewpoints publicly,’’ he said, adding that even constitutionally guaranteed proportional inclusion faces legal and political obstacles in practice.

He also linked exclusion to economic loss. “Nepal is losing 29 percent in human development every year. This translates to around 10 percent in GDP,” he said, attributing the decline to systemic inequality. Calling for reform in proportional representation, he said repeated occupation of the same seats restricts broader participation. “The path to inclusion remains very difficult,” he said.

The programme also featured poster exhibitions and CIA Group Presentations by 20 fellows of the Samabesita Fellowship, a two-month initiative focused on political literacy and awareness. The event marked the completion of the fellowship, with fellows and participants receiving certificates of participation.

Concluding the programme, Bhagvati Adhikari, executive director of Nepal Mahila Ekata Samaj, said democratic reform requires public accountability.

“We are not trying to make things difficult for any caste, but rather questioning the privileges that the caste system brings,” she said. “Our democracy is weakening because we only question from behind the scenes. To keep democracy alive, we must start questioning.”","{'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logos/thekathmandupost-logo-white.png', 'https://openweathermap.org/img/w/50d.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logos/thekathmandupost-logo.png', 'https://assets-cdn.kathmandupost.com/uploads/source/news/2026/third-party/image-1771549627.jpg', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/tkp-logo-weekender.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/lazy.png', 'https://jcss-cdn.kathmandupost.com/assets/images/logo-sticky-bar-tkp-weekender-1.png'}","नागरिक समाज के नेता, युवा प्रतिनिधि आ समुदाय के अधिवक्ता सब नेपाल के लोकतांत्रिक व्यवस्था में सशक्त समावेश आ जवाबदेही के आह्वान करैत कहलनि जे, संरचनात्मक बाधा के कारण राजनीति में के भाग लैत अछि आ के बहिष्कृत रहत।
