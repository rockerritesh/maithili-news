“As it embarks on the final stages of the peace process with transitional justice… the United Nations stands ready to support Nepal to develop a process that meets international standards, the Supreme Court’s rulings, and the needs of victims – and to put it into practice.”

– António Guterres, the United Nations Secretary-General, while on an official visit to Nepal in October 2023.

“Even though I’ve lost my husband, when I was registering the case, I felt that I was progressing. I felt a sense of peace almost, and growing confidence. At last, I was able to speak. Right now, there is no way for me even to get my husband’s pension. Either they have to tell me that my husband is no longer alive and give me the body. Or they should give me hope. The people who did this should be made to stand in a court of law.”

– Yog Maya Dahal whose husband was forcibly disappeared by security forces in 2002. Despite a court case and other promised investigations, she said that there is no apparent progress.

It has been almost two decades since the civil war in Nepal ended in 2006 with the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. The former Maoist insurgents have been demobilized and an elected assembly has adopted a federal, republican constitution. Conducting a transitional justice process remains the major outstanding commitment of the peace agreement. A moment of opportunity now exists to deliver a truth and justice process that is sought by victims, and one that would help protect the rights of all Nepalis in the future.

On his visit to Nepal in October 2023, UN Secretary-General António Guterres noted that Nepal is closer than it has ever been to beginning a meaningful transitional justice process. The government has pledged to enact a new law, with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal saying in December 2023, ""The victims want the speedy advancement of this process. The government too shares the same aspiration. There is no situation to remain in confusion and doubt.”

But the draft bill that is before parliament, while it contains some good provisions including for reparations, still needs significant amendments if it is to meet standards set by Nepal’s Supreme Court, and clearly established in international law, as well as victims’ justice needs. Under the bill as it currently stands, some of the gross violations of human rights described in this report may be placed outside the scope of Nepal’s transitional justice process.

There is a risk that – if the law falls short – the process will unravel again, failing victims and everyone else with a stake in completing the peace process or strengthening the rule of law in Nepal.

This report by Human Rights Watch and Nepal-based Advocacy Forum-Nepal describes survivors and victims’ decades-long search for truth, accountability, and reparations. There has been little or no progress in the 62 cases of conflict-era extrajudicial killings filed before Nepali courts with the support of Advocacy Forum-Nepal (see appendix), which we have tracked through a series of five previous reports since 2008. In defiance of court orders to investigate these killings, successive governments instructed police not to act in these cases, claiming that all conflict-era violations must be handled by a transitional justice process that has never been in operation.

As the table in the appendix shows, these families of victims of extrajudicial killings have typically received “interim relief” payments, but recommendations by the National Human Rights Commission to pay them compensation have been inconsistent, and frequently such recommendations (when made) have not been implemented.

Victims of the armed conflict between Maoist insurgents and government forces from 1996 to 2006, which killed up to 17,000 people and left up to 3,288 “disappeared,” have long been denied justice and reparations. They have gone to Nepali courts, to transitional justice commissions established by government, to the United Nations, and foreign jurisdictions. But accountability efforts at the domestic level have repeatedly been stalled by authorities that remained committed to impunity.

In addition, many survivors of sexual violence, who have faced severe social stigma, were unable to register their cases when conflict-era human rights violations were being recorded by the government between 2016-2018. Unlike the victims of some other crimes, survivors of sexual violence and torture and ill treatment never received financial “interim relief,” although many suffer from lasting physical and psychological injuries.

In several of the cases described in this report, witnesses and relatives of the victims alleged that commanding officers were directly responsible or were present when violations occurred. Some of the worst, well documented, human rights violations occurred in Banke district and the adjoining Bardiya district, in southwest Nepal. Families said that they found no remedy after engaging with the dysfunctional transitional justice institutions that have existed to date, and that they are still struggling financially.

One of the alleged perpetrators of torture, sexual violence, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings at the Chisapani army camp in Banke district, identified by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and Nepal’s National Human Rights Commission, as well as by witnesses who spoke to Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum, is former army captain Ramesh Swar. His former commanding officer, then army major (later brigadier general) Ajit Thapa is also alleged by OHCHR and the National Human Rights Commission to be responsible for torture and enforced disappearances. Although several complaints have been filed against them the police have not acted. While Swar and Thapa are yet to be prosecuted and have the right to defend themselves in proceedings where they have the presumption of innocence, these are only two examples among many alleged perpetrators where the police have not acted to investigate allegations, while the victims and their families continue to wait for truth and justice.

Until Nepal implements a transitional justice process that meets international standards, foreign governments and the United Nations should tighten vetting measures to prevent alleged perpetrators of serious violations who continue to obstruct justice from receiving international appointments. Alleged perpetrators who do travel abroad should be investigated under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which enables national authorities to investigate and prosecute certain of the most serious crimes under international law no matter where they were committed, and regardless of the nationality of the suspects or their victims.

Accountability for serious crimes under international law is an essential component of any credible transitional justice process, but it is not the only element. The UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence has identified five pillars of a transitional justice process. They are: truth, justice, reparation, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence. Nepal has so far failed to deliver any of these.

Many survivors and families of victims are in urgent need of relief and reparation for the harms they suffered and are living in difficult circumstances because of ongoing harms from the conflict, such as the loss of a wage-earner in their family, or injuries they sustained including psychosocial injuries. In numerous statements made during and after Secretary-General Guterres’s October 2023 visit to Nepal, victims’ groups called for a process that includes all the different elements of transitional justice, including accountability and reparations.

Nepal’s Crisis of Impunity

In 2014 Nepal’s legislature adopted the Commission on Investigation of Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Act (TRC Act), which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2015 because it failed to meet Nepali and international legal standards, especially by providing amnesties for serious crimes.

“Amnesties for these atrocities would convey to Nepalese society that some people are above the law,” UN experts had noted in July 2014, warning that, “Legislation which should enable the country to come to terms with its past, may further entrench impunity.”

It is now widely recognized by human rights defenders that a lack of accountability for conflict-era violations has led to a crisis of impunity in Nepal. The police and security forces are rarely, if ever, investigated for deaths in custody allegedly resulting from torture, or the killing of protesters. Nor are politicians and officials held accountable for widespread corruption that undermines public services and impinges economic and social rights.

Although the Supreme Court ruled against the TRC Act in 2015, two transitional justice bodies provided for in that law – the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (CIEDP) – were established that year. While the law has been suspended, the two commissions have continued to exist, although neither has completed a single investigation.

Advocacy Forum lawyers have consistently requested updates from police and prosecutors every three months on the 62 investigations tracked by Advocacy Forum and Human Rights Watch since 2006. They are repeatedly told that conflict-era cases are no longer being pursued because they will be processed by the two transitional justice mechanisms (the TRC and the CIEDP). In several of these cases, the Supreme Court itself has ordered a prompt investigation into killings. In acquiescing to government orders, the police ignored court directives. The fact that the police are choosing to obey executive orders over rulings by the judiciary exposes deeply rooted problems of the rule of law and political interference in the police.

This pattern of impunity is maintained in numerous cases of human rights violations committed since the conflict ended; there has been little or no attempt to hold alleged perpetrators to account, further eroding the rule of law. The government has failed to act on hundreds of recommendations by the National Human Rights Commission to prosecute alleged human rights abusers, or numerous recommendations of the UN Human Rights Committee.

The recommendations made in this report include measures that would help to prevent ongoing abuses by security forces and hold those responsible to account.

Legislation Before Parliament

On March 19, 2023, the newly elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Dahal tabled a bill in parliament titled A Bill Prepared for the Amendment of the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, 2071 (2014).

The bill includes several positive provisions. It guarantees the right to reparation, although it provides few details of how this will be done, as well as interim relief for some victims who were left out of earlier relief packages. It guarantees the right of the families of victims of enforced disappearance to their relatives’ property. It also mandates the TRC to study the root causes and impact of the conflict and recommend institutional reforms.

Under the proposals, the TRC and CIEDP would investigate alleged crimes committed during the conflict. Cases classified as “serious violations of human rights” could be referred to and prosecuted in a special court. However, the bill’s definition of “serious violations” – which includes rape and “serious sexual violence,” enforced disappearance, “cruel or inhuman torture,” and a definition of unlawful killing that remains to be finalized – excludes numerous serious crimes under international law including some acts of torture and some unlawful killings thus creating a significant accountability gap.

In a separate category from those crimes defined as “serious,” the bill defines “any acts against the domestic law, international human rights law or humanitarian law” as rights violations that cannot be referred to the special court. This language risks providing de facto amnesties to alleged perpetrators of some serious human rights violations and grave crimes under international law. Amnesties for serious crimes are contrary to international law and standards, and raise serious concerns for victims.

In particular, the definition of both “serious” violations and other violations of human rights stipulates that the offence was committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community.” This means that perpetrators of crimes committed against combatants, or in a non-targeted or planned manner, are excluded not only from any possibility of criminal accountability but also that the victims of these crimes are not eligible for consideration for other measures outlined in the bill, such as reparations.

In addition, the bill does not ensure the independent appointment of judges to the special court, nor the selection of qualified personnel to handle the complexities of serious crime investigations and prosecutions.

The government has come under pressure from victims’ groups, activists and international human rights organisations, the United Nations and others, to address the shortcomings of the bill including the critical issue of amnesties for serious crimes. On May 19, 2023, the Parliamentary Committee on Law, Justice, and Human Rights formed an 11-member sub-committee to propose amendments to the bill. The result of its deliberations became public in October 2023. Several of the sub-committee’s proposals, if they are adopted, would help to address some of the concerns that have been raised. However, the proposed amendments do not fully address several important shortcomings.

Under the proposed amendments, the requirement that any rights violation (whether defined as “serious” or not) must have been committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community” to fall within the scope of the process remains, excluding many victims and their families. Only crimes defined as “serious human rights violations” may be prosecuted, and these continue to exclude some war crimes and crimes against humanity, which, contrary to international law, would therefore be subject to amnesties. The status of the crime of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings was not settled by the sub-committee, but left open for further discussion.

Finally, the bill does not provide for the financial independence of the transitional justice bodies, and the sub-committee report does not address this. According to a recent report by the UN special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, transparent funding that provides sufficient material and human resources is key to guaranteeing the independence of transitional justice mechanisms.

While public debate and human rights activism have helped to introduce improvements to the bill, and there is important progress towards adopting a long overdue law on transitional justice, the draft law and proposed amendments do not currently comply with the rulings of the Supreme Court, international legal standards, or the demands of many victims. If it is passed without appropriate amendments, the law risks hindering the search for justice setting it back years once again. If it is appropriately amended, it can be the basis for a meaningful, nationally owned process that upholds the rights of victims by providing accountability and reparations, and benefit all Nepalis by strengthening institutions and the rule of law.

Recommendations

To the Government of Nepal

On Transitional Justice

Amend the transitional justice bill to ensure that all conduct amounting to gross violations of human rights and grave international crimes, including summary and arbitrary killings, torture, all war crimes and crimes against humanity, and including violations committed against combatants, are brought to the jurisdiction of the Special Court and are not subject to amnesties.

Amend the transitional justice bill to ensure that the definition of victims of any rights violation is not limited to “unarmed civilians ,” but also includes combatants.

Allow adequate time for those victims, including survivors of sexual violence, who have not filed a complaint to register their complaint once the commissions are set up under the new act and conduct a broad public awareness campaign to ensure that people across the country are aware of this process. The currently proposed window of three months to register sexual violence cases is not adequate.

Create a specialist unit within the TRC to handle cases of sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence. Ensure that it is staffed with people with training and skills in assisting survivors of gender-based violence, and has policies in place to protect survivors’ confidentiality and to support them in a respectful and victim-centered manner.

Ensure the bill provides for financial and administrative independence from the government for the commissions, and that the commissions can access additional resources if and when required.

Ensure that the bill provides for the independent appointment of judges to the Special Court, consistent with the standards in Nepal’s constitution. · Having adopted the necessary amendments, present the bill for passage by parliament without further unnecessary delay.

Establish the Special Court as soon as possible after the amended bill is passed, ensuring that the Special Court is adequately resourced, and that it is staffed with qualified personnel to handle the complexities of serious crime cases.

Establish a dedicated unit within the Office of the Attorney General to handle the prosecution of cases before the Special Court, based on adequate criminal investigation of serious crimes.

Office of the Attorney General Appoint qualified and independent commissioners to the TRC and CIEPD through a credible, transparent, and consultative process.

Develop a robust framework for reparations, based on recommendations from the TRC and the CIEPD though extensive consultations with victims, civil society, reparation experts, and other relevant stakeholders. This framework should: Recognize that victims of gross human rights violations and serious international crimes have a right to reparations under international law. Acknowledge the possibility of different forms of reparations based on victims’ needs, encompassing restitution, compensation, rehabilitation such as access to health services including mental health services and access to good quality education for victims and their family members, satisfaction, and guarantee of nonrecurrence. These reparations can be collective or individual and should include assistance to the children of victims and survivors. Extend to all victims of gross human rights violations and serious international crimes, including those previously excluded by the Interim Relief Program (i.e. survivors of torture, rape, and sexual violence). Be gender-sensitive and inclusive. Ensure that relief, service, and reparations are not one size fits all for all recipients, but are responsive to the specific needs of different recipients, including taking into account the specific needs of survivors of sexual violence and their families.



On the Criminal Justice System

Improve training and equipment, including strengthening the crime-investigation curriculum at police academies and training low-ranking officers to assist in crime investigations.

Enforce in practice section 9 of the Evidence Act, which excludes from court any evidence police obtain by using torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in interrogations.

Revise the Penal Code to abolish the statute of limitations for rape cases.

Conduct training and adopt new policies to improve how police handle cases involving gender-based violence, and hold accountable any officers that fail to comply with these policies.

Clearly and unequivocally signal, through statements and measures by state officials and the highest-ranking police, that the use of torture or other mistreatment in police custody is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Explicitly define acceptable interrogation techniques in police rules and manuals.

Ensure that police officers implicated in torture and other ill-treatment, regardless of rank, are disciplined or prosecuted as appropriate.

Stop transferring police alleged to have committed abuses, which only endangers other citizens. Establish that if a police officer is being investigated for abusive conduct they will be assigned to desk duty or suspended with pay, depending on the allegation, until the incident is investigated and resolved.

Bolster independent investigations into complaints of police abuse and misconduct through the national human rights commission and police complaints authorities. Prosecute accused officers where sufficient evidence exists.

Reduce delays and malfeasance by requiring police to register a First Information Report (FIR) for any complaint, regardless of jurisdiction, before transferring a case to the appropriate police station. Where sufficient grounds exist, investigate suspected crimes when no FIR has been registered.

Strengthen public prosecutors and develop a strong public legal defense system.

Allow all detainees access to lawyers, with communication in confidence, without obstruction by the police.

To Foreign Governments Seeking to Support Transitional Justice in Nepal and the United Nations

Help the government of Nepal to seize the current opportunity by urging it to amend the current bill to meet international standards, and then promptly pass it into law.

Liaise directly and regularly with victim and survivor groups, including survivors of sexual violence, to ensure that international engagement with the government of Nepal is informed by their views.

Provide financial support to victims’ groups, to ensure that they have the means to conduct meetings, discussions, and awareness campaigns among their members.

Offer technical and financial assistance for a process that complies with Nepal’s obligations under international law.

Ensure that any donor funding for Nepal’s transitional justice process is delivered through a mechanism that ensures best practice, including transparency and independence from the government. Consider a structure to coordinate donor support that is under the auspices of the United Nations.

Closely observe the process of appointment to help ensure that TRC and CIEDP commissioners are selected through a credible and independent process that has the confidence of stakeholders.

Ensure that funds allocated for reparations to victims are administered in a transparent and accountable manner according to clearly articulated principles and procedures.

Investigate and prosecute alleged serious crimes committed in Nepal using the principle of universal jurisdiction.

Methodology

Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum have tracked the status of 62 cases documented in 49 FIRs filed with police since June 2006. Of these, 46 relate to cases of alleged extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, or rape committed by security forces in the period between 2002 and 2006. The remaining FIRs relate to cases of alleged killings by members of the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M). Advocacy Forum lawyers assisted and continue to assist the families in seeking justice in all these cases. Advocacy Forum’s lawyers based in seven provinces of Nepal monitor any progress in these cases quarterly.

In February 2023 Human Rights Watch visited Banke and Bardiya districts with Advocacy Forum to interview victim families, some of whom were involved in the cases mentioned above. In addition, a Human Rights Watch researcher conducted interviews in Kathmandu with survivors of sexual violence from various districts. All of the survivors, victims and families mentioned in this report consented for their cases to be included. No payments were made for the information included in this report. We also reviewed documents including draft legislation and analyses of the bill by various organizations, recommendations made by victims and civil society organizations, and communications from UN Special Procedures.

Human Rights Watch wrote to Ajit Thapa and Agni Sapkota asking for their response to the issues raised in this report. We were unable to identify an address at which to write to Ramesh Swar. Human Rights Watch also wrote to Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal asking for his response to the issues raised in relation to the transitional justice bill. We had not received a response at the time of publication.

On February 2, 2023, Advocacy Forum wrote to the human rights cells of the Nepal Police and Nepal Army requesting meetings and a response to the issues raised in this report, but received no response. On May 15, 2023, Advocacy Forum wrote to the office of the Attorney General about the issues raised in this report, but received no response. The National Human Rights Commission responded to Advocacy Forum’s RTI application, providing their decisions on some of the cases mentioned in the report. Those updates are included in the table in the appendix.

I. Background, Nepal’s Maoist Conflict 1996-2006

In 1996, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) declared a “people’s war” to establish a communist republic. Nepal had been a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy since a democratic street movement in 1990, which had forced an end to absolute monarchy. By 2001, the insurgents had established significant control in around 22 of Nepal’s 75 districts, attempting to assume the functions of a state.

During the early years of the conflict, the government relied on the ill-equipped and poorly trained Nepal Police to confront the Maoists. The Maoists attacked police stations, killing hundreds of police officers. By the end of the conflict in 2006, 1,271 out of 1,971 police posts across the country had stopped functioning after they were destroyed in attacks, or police personnel had been withdrawn for security reasons. The Maoists also targeted and killed “class enemies” in rural areas, including members of the parliamentary parties and landowning families.

Peace talks between the government and the Maoists, which began in August 2001, broke down in November that year after the Maoists unilaterally withdrew and attacked police and army posts in 42 districts, killing around 80 members of the security forces. The authorities responded by declaring a nationwide state of emergency and deploying the Royal Nepal Army (RNA, now Nepal Army, NA). The Nepal Police and the paramilitary Armed Police Force (APF) were placed under the “unified command” of the army.

Following the deployment of the army the conflict escalated. In particular, the civilian death toll mounted. Over 8,000 mostly civilian deaths were recorded between November 2001 and the end of the war in 2006, out of a total death toll estimated by the UN in 2012 at over 13,000 people. Other widely cited estimates of the total death toll have later been revised upwards to around 17,000 people.

In 2002, the government introduced the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance (TADO), granting wide powers to the security forces to arrest people involved in “terrorist” activities and declared the CPN-M a “terrorist organization.” In May that year parliament was dissolved, and in October, King Gyanendra fired the prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba. Over the following years, a series of prime ministers were appointed and dismissed by the king, while parliamentary parties protested the palace’s role in politics.

A second failed round of peace talks in 2003 broke down after the army massacred 17 Maoists and two civilians in custody at Doramba, in Ramechhap district, in August that year. While the Maoists had established control over much of the countryside, the security forces operated from heavily fortified bases in the district headquarters, launching search operations and patrols.

The international community acted on longstanding calls from national and international human rights groups to set up a monitoring mission of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in April 2005.

On February 1, 2005, King Gyanendra declared a state of emergency and – with the army’s backing – assumed direct executive authority, citing the inability of the civilian government to resolve the conflict. He ordered the detention of politicians, activists, journalists, and human rights defenders, and imposed severe restrictions on civil liberties. Protests broke out, backed by the parliamentary parties and the Maoists.

The Maoists’ unilateral decision to begin a four-month ceasefire, from September 3, 2005, was not joined by the royal government. The parliamentary parties established a Seven-Party Alliance (SPA) and entered a dialogue with the Maoists, facilitated by the government of India. On November 22, 2005, the SPA and the Maoists adopted a 12-point “Letter of Understanding,” which included a call for the election of a constituent assembly and committed the Maoists to multi-party democracy, respect for human rights, and the rule of law. The agreement, strongly criticized by the royal government, was welcomed by then UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan.

There were talks between representatives of the SPA and Maoists in New Delhi in March 2006, leading to a combined, peaceful street movement. Thousands of people took part in massive demonstrations across the country in defiance of curfew orders.

On April 24, 2006, the king announced the reinstatement of parliament. A government under Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, leader of the Nepali Congress party, was formed. The government started negotiations with the CPN-M on the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which was signed by Prime Minister Koirala and the Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal on November 21, 2006.

II. Rights Violations in Southwest Nepal

Human rights abuses occurred across the country during the conflict. Security forces were accused of extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrests. The Maoists abducted and executed “class enemies,” practiced widespread extortion, and forcibly recruited children – including into combat. Both sides stand accused of rape, although the majority of allegations are against the security forces.

Many well documented violations occurred in Banke and Bardiya districts, in southwestern Nepal. OHCHR received reports of over 200 enforced disappearances in the custody of the security forces in Bardiya district alone between December 2001 and January 2003, as well as 14 similar cases in Maoist custody between November 2002 and October 2004.

The marginalized Tharu Indigenous group then made-up 52 percent of Bardiya’s population and accounted for over 85 percent of the people forcibly disappeared by the state in cases documented by OHCHR. Most victims appear to have been civilians – among the “disappeared” just 23 were acknowledged by their families or by the CPN-M to have been members of the Maoist party at the time of their detention.

OHCHR found that three units of the RNA based in Bardiya District during this period were primarily responsible for enforced disappearances, as well as unlawful detentions, torture in custody and extrajudicial killings. Among them was Bhimkali Company, based at the Chisapani army camp on the border of Bardiya and Banke districts, which operated in both districts. In several of the cases described in this report, witnesses and relatives of the victims alleged that commanding officers were directly responsible or were present when violations occurred.

The UN found that Bhimkali Company “was under the command of Major Ajit Thapa and Captain Ramesh Swar (second in command), during the period under investigation... Testimonies frequently cited the two commanding officers, Major Ajit Thapa and Captain Ramesh Swar, as being present and involved in interrogation and torture.”

Several victims told OHCHR that torture took place in Major Thapa’s office. Major Thapa and Captain Swar were also named in a 2006 report by the UN special rapporteur on Torture, which included detailed testimony from a man who said he was tortured at Chisapani by both officers. The OHCHR report, and a report by Amnesty International published in 2002, both contain allegations that Captain Swar raped female prisoners.

Several witnesses told Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum that Captain Swar was directly responsible for violations including extrajudicial killing. The National Human Rights Commission has alleged that Ramesh Swar was responsible in at least ten cases of enforced disappearance, and that Ajit Thapa was responsible for at least five, and recommended that they be prosecuted.

Families of the “Disappeared” and Victims of Extrajudicial Killings

According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, over 1,300 people remain victims of enforced disappearance since the end of the war. The Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) was formed in 2015 as part of the transitional justice process to investigate civil war abuses. The CIEDP say they have received 3,288 cases of people allegedly forcibly disappeared, but is yet to complete an investigation into a single enforced disappearance, and to date no perpetrator has been held accountable.

Many victims and their families have struggled to learn the truth of what happened, to gain reparations and redress, including support for victims’ children and rights to the property of the “disappeared.” Several of the families whose interviews appear in this report filed criminal complaints before Nepali courts with support from Advocacy Forum. However, complainants found this route blocked by government directives to the police not to investigate conflict-related cases.

Some sought to advance accountability through international mechanisms. In 2011, the families of eight victims of enforced disappearance in Bardiya brought their cases to the UN Human Rights Committee, arguing that there were no effective domestic remedies available. The Human Rights Committee has adopted views supporting the complainants in this and at least 20 other cases from Nepal, finding that victims have been denied redress for serious human rights violations.

The Enforced Disappearance of Kamal Dahal

Yog Maya Dahal has struggled for justice since her husband, Kamal Dahal, was taken by soldiers from the school where he taught on January 1, 2002.

On the day he was detained, Yog Maya says soldiers came to her house in Banke district, searched it, and demanded to be taken to the school, accusing her husband of being a Maoist. “They took him out of the classroom and said, ‘This is the man who has widowed many wives.’” He was severely beaten before numerous witnesses and, unable to stand, thrown into the back of an army truck and driven away.

Yog Maya said that the soldiers had come from the nearby Chisapani army camp. The following day she went there to see her husband but was denied entry. The day after that news was broadcast on the radio that he had been killed in an “encounter” while trying to escape, but she was not informed or handed his body.

In the months following her husband’s abduction Yog Maya says soldiers from Chisapani including Major Ajit Thapa and Captain Ramesh Swar would visit her house at night. “I came to recognize them. They said, ‘Your husband has buried weapons here. You have to dig them up.’ I said, ‘The only weapons my husband used were chalk and a duster.’” The soldiers would point their guns through the (unglazed) windows of her house. “I would pretend that I was sleeping. ... I would gather the kids around me and sleep in the middle of the room.”

At first, she attached her hopes to finding Kamal’s body, but she never has, and her husband remains “disappeared.” “It feels like a nightmare,” she said.

The police only registered her complaint after a court ordered them to do so. But the case has made little progress. Yog Maya wants a transitional justice process that gives her relief and reparation. She has raised four children on her own, and without a death certificate cannot receive her husband’s pension. Besides reparations and access to her husband’s estate, she wants the perpetrators brought to justice. She believes “the case is stuck because the police haven’t been able to arrest [Major] Ajit [Thapa] and [Captain] Ramesh [Swar]. They didn’t show up in court… They were the ones who beat him up [when he was arrested], Ramesh Swar especially. They kicked him with their boots.”

“I would feel relief and peace if the case moved forward and I could confront them in the court,” she said. “The only thing that can give me a sense of justice is to see them being punished.”

Extrajudicial Killing of Kranti Abhilashi Devkota

Kranti Abhilashi Devkota of Banke district, who his family acknowledge was the district treasurer of a Maoist affiliated student organization, was shot dead by soldiers on December 30, 2001. The family had a tradition of involvement in communist politics and several members had become involved in the Maoist party. According to information received by the family, Kranti was detained by an army patrol at a village in neighboring Bardiya district and summarily executed almost immediately, in front of witnesses, while he pleaded for his life.

In the aftermath of the killing soldiers repeatedly visited the family home at night and threatened them at gunpoint, inflicting “mental torture.”

“Ten years ago, we thought there would be justice but now there is no hope,” said Kranti’s sister Shram Jyoti Devkota. “Those involved should be punished, but I don’t think it’s possible anymore.”

Indiscriminate Killing of Dal Bahadur Thapa and Parbati Thapa

“We are still waiting for justice,” Bhumi Sara Thapa Chhetri, 80, told Human Rights Watch. “I walked to so many places, every place that you have to go for justice, and I cried so much. Now I’ve grown old. I would like to see them brought to court. It feels like it will never come.”

Her family was preparing to go to bed for the night, in Rajhena village in Banke district, on September 10, 2002, when members of the security forces, seemingly including police and soldiers, appeared outside and opened fire into the house through the windows. When the firing stopped, she saw that her youngest son Dal Bahadur was dead and his wife Parbati was fatally injured. The couple’s 10-month-old daughter, the youngest of their two children, had also been wounded.

The security forces appeared to leave, but returned within a few minutes and began asking questions about Bhumi’s other children, whom they suspected of being Maoists, but who were not at home. The family named Major Ajit Thapa and Captain Ramesh Swar among those they accused in a criminal complaint (see table in appendix, cases number 5 and 6).

The security forces removed the bodies of Dal Bahadur and Parbati, and also removed jewelry, a video camera and 11,000 rupees (then worth around US$144). The surviving members of the family were locked inside the house. They were able to take the injured baby for medical treatment the following morning. That day a news item broadcast on the radio claimed that the security forces had killed two Maoists and recovered a video camera, 11,000 rupees and bomb making equipment.

“It was only after the peace agreement [in 2006] that we were able to register the case,” said Bhumi. Initially the police refused to register it, but with help from Advocacy Forum it was registered after a court gave an order to do so. However, there has been little if any discernable progress.

According to her youngest daughter, 38-year-old Lakshmi Thapa, “It was so difficult [to register and pursue the case], people wouldn’t listen, they wouldn’t follow orders. Two kids were orphaned that night. The state should take care of them. And the killers have to be punished for what they did.”

Torture of Prem Bahadur Thapa at Chisapani Army Camp

The Thapa family had had previous encounters with soldiers from the Chisapani army camp. One of Bhumi Sara’s other children, Prem Bahadur Thapa, said he had first been arrested about a year earlier. Accusing him and another villager of being Maoists, soldiers tied them to a stake and beat them. The soldiers also searched the family house, and then took Prem and the other villager in a truck to the Chisapani camp.

Prem Bahadur says he recognized several of the prisoners at Chisapani. “I saw many people from Kohalpur there,” he said. After his arrival, he was blindfolded, his hands were tied, and soldiers beat him in an open area inside the compound. “They probably broke four or five sticks beating me,” he said.

Prem Bahadur alleges that he was repeatedly tortured while held at Chisapani. One of the instruments of torture was a bamboo club wrapped in tires, which was known as the “Hanuman laathi” and left tire marks on the victims’ bodies. The soldiers based at Chisapani would conduct “raids” almost every day, Prem Bahadur said, and if they returned with new prisoners then the existing prisoners would be tortured less that day. He also says that while at Chipasani, he witnessed an officer beat a young woman to death.

After his release he was ordered to report again to the camp, but instead he fled to India. It was following Prem’s flight to India that security forces attacked his family home, as described above.

Enforced Disappearance of Shivacharan Tharu

“I’ve been to Kathmandu so many times staging protests,” said Mampti Tharu, describing her decades long search for justice.

Her husband, Shivacharan Tharu (also known as Shiv Charan Chaudhari) was arrested by police from his home in Bardiya district along with three other men on December 12, 2001. For over four months she was able to visit him in custody at a police station, and saw that he had been severely beaten. The last time she saw her husband was on April 29, 2002. The police told her that her husband had been transferred to the custody of the army at Thakurdwara. Since then, he remains a victim of enforced disappearance.

According to the United Nations’ 2008 report on enforced disappearances in Bardiya district, referring to Shivcharan and four other men who were detained in the same period, “OHCHR’s investigations suggest they were taken from the DPO [district police office] by a group of RNA, APF and NP [Nepal Police] personnel on 2/3 May [2002] and extrajudicially executed,” despite official claims that they were released.

Mampti registered the case with the CIEDP after they were established in 2015. “Until four or five years ago they [the CIEDP] would tell us ‘We will search for your husband.’ I don’t know what happened. The commission disappeared.”

ExtraJudicial Killing of Rupa Tharu

Rupa Tharu, also known as Rupa Chaudhary, was an 11-year-old primary school pupil when she was dragged from her bed and shot dead by soldiers during a night-raid on her village, Sorhawa, in Bardiya district, on July 21, 2002.

Her mother, Lakshmi Tharu, recalls that at around 10pm soldiers, who appeared to be drunk, broke the family’s door down and entered the house searching for an alleged Maoist named Rupa Tharu. They established that her daughter’s name was Rupa Tharu, kicked and beat her and her father with their gun butts, then dragged the child outside and shot her dead.

After shooting Rupa, soldiers ordered four village men to carry her body to the village primary school, where they had parked their vehicles. Three of the men were then released but one, named Dinesh Tharu, aged around 17 or 18, was taken away. According to Dinesh’s mother, Talukrani Tharu, he was held for around 15 days at Chisapani army camp, where he was continually blindfolded and repeatedly beaten before being released.

According to the OHCHR investigation in Bardiya district, following the killing of Rupa Tharu the Ministry of Defence issued a press statement “claiming that a Maoist was ‘killed in an encounter.’” Multiple witnesses told OHCHR that the security forces who raided the village were a joint team of soldiers from Bhimkali company (which was based at Chisapani army camp) and police from the Mainapokhar area police office.

Abuses Committed by the Maoists in Bardiya District

According to the OHCHR’s report on enforced disappearances in Bardiya, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist (CPN-M) was responsible for at least 14 abductions in the period they documented, between 2002-2004. In many cases the Maoists subsequently acknowledged that the victim had been killed, but did not reveal the location of their body.

For instance, on October 21, 2004, five Maoists abducted Anita Bishwakarma from her home, accusing her of extortion. She was breastfeeding her four-month-old son when the Maoists arrived. They handed her baby to a relative before blindfolding her and marching her away. In 2008, a CPN-M district representative acknowledged to OHCHR that Anita Bishwakarma had been killed as part of “party action.”

OHCHR also recorded that the Maoists were responsible for other abuses, including “recruit[ing] children under 18 into its ranks, several of whom were reportedly subsequently arrested and disappeared by the army.” Apart from killings, abductions and looting, the Maoists also carried out public executions, including by shooting and beheading. OCHCR concluded that “a significant number” of these actions “were clearly serious violations of IHL [international humanitarian law].”

CPN-M representatives informed OHCHR that all decisions on party “action,” including abductions and killings, were made by the party’s District Committee. The UN report gives the pseudonyms of the two most senior Maoists in the district at the time as Amal (Bright) and Tufan (Storm).

Victims’ Representatives in Bardiya district

Yojana Chaudhary is the chairwoman of a victim/ survivor network in Badhaiyatal Rural Municipality, which includes Sorhawa where 11-year-old Rupa Tharu was killed. She says that within her area, one of eight such local units in Bardiya district, her committee is aware of 65 people who were either killed or “disappeared” and around 65 to 70 others who suffered torture or were otherwise injured during the conflict.

Torture survivors and other injured people, she said, have particularly struggled to support their families. The families are anxious to receive reparations and livelihoods for their children, torture survivors in particular want health insurance and free treatment, and there are also calls for memorialization of victims, such as naming roads or public places after them. They also demand that perpetrators are held accountable. “Many victim families want to see justice served. They want to see perpetrators in court in their lifetime,” she said.

The UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence has identified five pillars of a transitional justice process. They are: truth, justice, reparation, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence. Nepal has so far failed to deliver any of these.

III. Survivors of Sexual Violence

Survivors of sexual violence committed during the conflict – the vast majority of whom are women – have faced even greater difficulty than others in demanding that the crimes committed against them should be acknowledged and that they should receive reparations and accountability. They are also at risk of being neglected by the transitional justice process. Activists campaigning for justice for survivors of sexual violence state that the TRC has recorded 314 alleged cases of sexual violence but argue that the true number of such cases is far higher.

Many of these women are living in dire financial conditions and continue to experience physical and mental health problems linked to the violence they faced. Although some victims of conflict-era abuses, such as the families of victims of extrajudicial executions, had earlier received “interim relief,” survivors of sexual violence and other torture survivors did not.

Due to social stigma, many survivors of sexual violence did not come forward to record their cases when the TRC was registering complaints between 2016 and 2018. Others found that officials were unwilling to register cases as rape or sexual violence, instead for example recording cases as “torture” or simply “injured.”

A statute of limitations in Nepal’s Penal Code prevents the prosecution of rape if the case is registered more than two years after the alleged offence, or three years after the victim turns 18 if she was a minor at that time.

In 2021, a new organization of women survivors of sexual violence, the National Organization of Wartime Rape Victims (NOWRaV), was established by survivors to support one another and advocate for the transitional justice process to address their needs. Their demands include:

To publicly acknowledge that rapes occurred widely during the conflict.

To reopen the registration of cases with the transitional justice bodies to allow survivors who had not previously registered to do so.

To immediately provide interim relief to survivors.

To immediately make provision for physical and mental healthcare for survivors.

To remove the statute of limitations for the prosecution of rape.

To ensure reparation and rehabilitation to survivors.

To make provision for the children of survivors, including for their education and healthcare. To officially recognize the experience and contribution of survivors.

To establish a specialized, victim-centric unit within the transitional justice mechanism to meet the needs of survivors of sexual violence.

Devi Maya Nepal

Devi Maya, a member of the marginalized Tharu Indigenous community, said that when she attempted to register her case with the TRC through the local Peace Committee they refused to write that she had been gang raped by the army, and instead recorded only that she was “injured.” She recalled that the committee was conducting the registration process in an open setting. Both men and women were present, and people laughed at her. There was no privacy or provision of counsellors for survivors.

“Every step of the way, whether I went to the DPO [district police office] or the Supreme Court, they said it wouldn’t be possible to prosecute this case because there is no law,” Devi Maya said. She therefore took her case to the UN Human Rights Committee in Geneva in 2015, arguing that there was no domestic remedy for the violation of her rights.

In her submission to the Human Rights Committee, Devi Maya alleged that she had been gang raped and beaten unconscious by soldiers inside her house when the army raided her village on August 20, 2002. She became pregnant as a result, and both she and her youngest daughter suffered stigma and discrimination. She “still suffers from severe physical and psychological consequences of the rape.”

In June 2022 the Committee published its finding that Devi Maya’s rights had been violated and she had been denied redress by Nepal’s legal system.

According to Devi Maya, following the outcome of her complaint in Geneva, local government and police officials in her district summoned her to a meeting. “Even when I came back, they threw down my file and made fun of me,” she said. The police have still not registered her complaint. Shortly after that meeting, in November 2022, unknown arsonists set fire to and destroyed the poultry farm where she lived.

Lakshmi N.

“I was too scared to register as a rape survivor, so I just say I am a conflict victim. That’s how I am registered in the TRC,” said Lakshmi Nepali, who was raped by Maoist fighters in Far West Nepal in September 2001. Lakshmi had just had a baby and was washing clothes at the river near her parent’s house when a unit of six Maoists appeared. “One of them I recognized as a childhood friend. There was a forest near the river and the six of them dragged me there. There was nobody around and my screams were not heard. I was left naked by the riverbank.”

She says her father and older brother found her and took her to the health post, but they did not want to discuss the rape. “My brother and father knew that I was raped but they did not raise a voice for justice,” she said. “Instead, they sent me to my husband’s house. From that day on I have not returned to my parents. How could I? They have seen my naked body. I am so ashamed.” She never filed a police complaint. However, one of the rapists was later killed by security forces. “I saw the body of that rapist,” she said. “I felt a sense of justice that day.” Lakshmi says she would like some form of acknowledgement and reparation for her pain. “I really need some support with health and treatments. My son has mental health issues. I need to get him treatment, but these things are beyond me.”

Sita N.

“What I need is interim relief so I can fight for justice and take the perpetrator to court,” Sita Nepali told Human Rights Watch.

When she registered her rape case with the Local Peace Committee in her district, she found the committee did not appear to follow any formal procedures or take any steps to ensure confidentiality. The TRC had mandated the Local Peace Committee to record conflict era complaints during 2016-2018. “The TRC is simply not capable of handling these cases,” she concluded.

On June 2, 2020, the National Human Rights Commission gave Sita a letter acknowledging that she had been arrested by the army and police on March 4, 2002, been subjected to sexual violence, and that she should receive Rupees 300,000 compensation (around US$4,000). She said that she went from one government department to another, but never received any money. “I have been to every office at every level of government,” she said.

She was required to bring five witnesses to her local police station, and as a result her entire village knows about her complaint. “The NHRC is so insensitive that when I went back to say I couldn’t get my compensation they all laughed at me.”

Gayatri N.

“I want to be able to sit in front of the perpetrators and confront them in the presence of lawyers. Even if it is the day before I die, I would like to see justice. Even if I can experience it for just one day,” said Gayatri.

Gayatri N. had been a member of a Maoist Party committee representing farmers. On September 7, 2001, she was abducted by pro-government vigilantes. Her home was burnt, and her 12-year-old son became a victim of enforced disappearance. During her captivity she was subjected to extreme sexual violence. Two girls or young women who were abducted along with Gayatri, and who were also raped while held captive, were never seen again. Gayatri was freed after her husband signed over their family’s modest property to the abductors as a ransom for her release.

When she attempted to register her case with the district’s Local Peace Committee she requested a female interviewer, but the committee refused. She does not know whether rape and sexual violence was registered among the numerous violations committed against her.

She said that the men who allegedly “disappeared” her child, burnt her home, abducted and abused her, are currently active in politics.

Other Survivors Seeking Reparations and Justice

Many survivors emphasize other needs, besides criminal accountability. Many are unable to identify the perpetrators. Most still suffer physical or psychological pain and require medical treatment and counselling. Some have not disclosed to their own families what happened to them, and believe they never can. “There is no way we will ever get back the dignity we lost. What we need is health insurance in a good hospital, physical treatment and counselling,” said rape survivor Bhavani N.

“We want scholarships for our children,” said another survivor, Gauri N., pointing out that under Nepal’s citizenship laws it is difficult for a child with an unknown father to obtain citizenship and therefore access to education and formal employment. “We want our children to be able to study without limitations, free of cost.”

IV. The Long Struggle for Transitional Justice

The struggle to uphold the rule of law and achieve justice for crimes committed by both sides in Nepal’s conflict began before the conflict ended. At great personal risk, victims, witnesses and Nepali human rights defenders worked to expose abuses and to gather and preserve evidence.

Nepal’s courts intervened in numerous habeas corpus cases, ordering the release of prisoners held in illegal detention. International groups gathered and publicized evidence of abuses and called for accountability. United Nations special procedures repeatedly intervened in individual cases and to document patterns of abuse. In 2012 OHCHR published the comprehensive Nepal Conflict Report covering the entire decade-long conflict.

The 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement included a commitment “to investigate [the] truth about people seriously violating human rights and involved in crimes against humanity.” Along with drafting a new constitution, and demobilizing and integrating Maoist former fighters, implementing a transitional justice process was recognized as a core pillar of the peace process.

However, while the integration of Maoist fighters was completed in around 2013, and a new constitution was promulgated in 2015, progress towards delivering justice has been stalled. Transitional justice is composed of five main pillars: providing accountability for perpetrators, reparations for victims, truth telling, memorialization, and guarantees of non-recurrence. These components are necessarily linked. While accountability has been the most difficult issue for politicians in Nepal, they have been unable to proceed without addressing it.

In June 2007, the Supreme Court of Nepal issued a landmark decision in response to habeas corpus petitions in dozens of enforced disappearance cases. The ruling ordered the government to establish a commission of inquiry, enact a law to criminalize enforced disappearances in accordance with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, prosecute those responsible for disappearances, and provide compensation to victims’ families.

In February 2010 the government presented two bills to parliament, to establish a truth and reconciliation commission and a commission of inquiry into enforced disappearances. These bills, which ruled out amnesty for murder, enforced disappearances, torture, and rape, were not enacted.

In 2013, the government issued the Ordinance on Investigation of Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, based on the earlier bills, but removing the provisions that prevented the commissions from recommending amnesty, and incorporating mediation between victims and perpetrators irrespective of the nature of violations. The ordinance was successfully challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled in January 2014 that any mechanism for transitional justice must conform to international legal standards, lead to accountability for serious human rights violations, and guarantee victims their right to remedy and reparation. The Supreme Court also said that the government should enact laws that criminalize gross human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, torture, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.

On May 11, 2014, Nepal’s Constituent Assembly ignored the Supreme Court ruling and enacted the Commission on Investigation of Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Act 2014 (TRC Act). The act retained the provision of amnesty and mediation, including for murder, enforced disappearances, torture, and rape. It provided for the creation of two commissions, the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), which were established in 2015.

In July 2014, UN experts warned that the recently adopted transitional justice law leaves mass violations unaddressed. “Amnesties for these atrocities would convey to Nepalese society that some people are above the law,” and “legislation which should enable the country to come to terms with its past, may further entrench impunity.” OHCHR provided a detailed analysis of how Nepal’s transitional justice legislation failed to meet basic international human rights standards. In February 2015 the Supreme Court ruled that the TRC Act was unlawful, especially provisions that shield those responsible for the most serious abuses from prosecution. The government filed a petition seeking to overturn the judgment. On April 27, 2020, the government’s petition was rejected by the Supreme Court.

Interim Relief

Between 2008-2012 the government implemented an Interim Relief Programme (IRP) to help meet the immediate needs of conflict victims. Local Peace Committees (LPCs), formed from members of political parties at the district level, recorded cases and distributed one-time cash payments to some victims or their families.

Families of the deceased and disappeared were given NPR 100,000 (then around US$ 1,300), and scholarships ranging from NPR 10,000-16,000 (around US$ 130-210) were offered to children of the deceased, and these payments were later increased. Payments of up to NPR 200,000 (US$ 2,600) were offered to people who had suffered disabilities, and compensation was also offered to people whose property was damaged or destroyed during the conflict. Benefits were provided to over 30,000 people who were categorized as “conflict victims” and approximately 80,000 internally displaced people. Funding for the program was largely met through international aid.

However, some categories of victims and survivors, notably those who had suffered sexual violence or torture, were excluded from the program. The LPCs were widely seen to act in an arbitrary and politicized way, for example giving preferential treatment to the supporters of the political parties represented on the committee.

The Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)

The Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP) and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) were established on February 10, 2015, under the 2014 act. Commissioners were selected through a flawed process led by political parties and without the involvement of victims’ groups.

In April 2016 the two commissions began registering cases, largely delegating the task to the Local Peace Committees already established in the districts. The committees, which did not have specialized skills or training, were inconsistent and arbitrary. For example, as several survivors of sexual violence told Human Rights Watch, the committees sometimes refused to register rape allegations or ensure confidentiality for women making complaints.

In their initial two-year term, the commissions could barely begin work as they lacked sufficient human and financial resources, fell prey to in-fighting among members, and were hampered by political interference. After the two-year mandates of the commissions expired in February 2017, the government extended them for one year. In January 2018 they were again extended by a year. By 2018, when there was a deadline for filing cases, the TRC had received 60,298 complaints of human rights violations, and the CIEDP had received 3,093 complaints of enforced disappearance.

In June 2018, the then attorney general invited national and international human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch to discuss a proposed bill amending the 2014 law. While some of the proposed amendments were a welcome step forward, the law needed further strengthening to comply with international standards. The government later shelved the proposal.

On March 25, 2019, the government appointed a committee chaired by a former chief justice to recommend new TRC and CIEDP commissioners, as their terms were once again expiring. Advocacy Forum found that by the end their tenure in 2019 the commissions were still in the preliminary phase of their work:

The TRC had completed preliminary investigations in less than 10 percent of the complaints and the CIEDP had commenced preliminary investigation in 75 percent of complaints... Neither had resolved even one case out of the more than 60,000 complaints lodged by victims.

Hoping that the process to appoint new commissioners would provide an opportunity to bring the transitional justice process on track, rights groups helped victims’ associations hold consultations in 20 districts to solicit preliminary recommendations. They called on the government to proceed systematically by first holding wider consultations, then amending the transitional justice law incorporating directives of the Supreme Court and Nepal’s international human rights obligations, and finally appointing new commissioners after the act had been amended.

Instead, the government held rushed consultations in January 2020 in all seven provincial headquarters with only three days’ notice, a process that “victims and civil society perceived as window dressing.” The appointments were made without amending the legal framework. The new commissioners took their oath of office on January 23, 2020. After being extended in July 2022 the commissioners’ terms expired on October 17, 2022, and their posts are currently vacant.

V. Searching for Justice Through the Courts

Since 2008 Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum have published six reports tracking 62 cases of extrajudicial killing in which victims’ families, supported by Advocacy Forum, have sought justice through the ordinary Nepali courts. In some of these cases, after the police refused to register complaints known as First Information Reports (FIRs) the courts ordered them to register cases and carry out investigations. In others, there were interventions by the National Human Rights Commission.

While successive governments failed to establish a credible transitional justice process, they also sought to block conflict-related cases in the ordinary courts. There has been hardly any progress toward prosecution since 2011 in any of the 62 cases.

When Advocacy Forum lawyers reached out to the police seeking information on investigations of these complaints, they were repeatedly told that conflict-era cases were no longer being pursued because they will be processed by the transitional justice process.

The government has also ignored the United Nations Human Rights Committee (HRC) when it repeatedly called on Nepal to thoroughly investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible in at least 21 cases brought to it under the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The HRC rejected the argument of the government that local remedies have not yet been exhausted (a requirement under the HRC rules), emphasizing that pending commission investigations and proceedings are not sufficient and cannot be a substitute for criminal investigations and prosecutions of serious abuses.

In acquiescing to government orders, the police ignored court directives. In several cases, the Supreme Court itself has ordered a prompt investigation into killings. For example, in the case related to the murder of two brothers, Nar Bahadur Budhamagar and Ratan Bahadur Budhamagar, the Supreme Court issued an order in April 2017 noting that the “constitutional guarantee of human rights remains illusionary if police fails to investigate such a serious crime for such a long period of time.” It further said that “such an indifference to the duty to investigate and prosecute severely undermines the public’s confidence in the rule of law.”

On April 16, 2017, the Kavre district court sentenced three officers to life imprisonment for the murder of Maina Sunuwar, a 15-year-old girl who was tortured to death in army custody in February 2004. An arrest warrant issued in 2008 was never enforced, with the police telling the court they were unable to trace the accused despite the fact that some of them were still serving in the army.

On September 1, 2017, the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Nepal Army filed a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court seeking annulment of the convictions ordered by the district court. The army claimed that the incident cannot come under the jurisdiction of the regular court because it happened during a military operation, and therefore military rules should apply. The Nepal Army also said that the officers concerned had already been tried by court martial, and were therefore placed in double jeopardy, and that the case should thus be handled by the TRC.

Another emblematic case is the 2005 abduction and killing by Maoist party members of Arjun Lama, a 46-year-old school official in Kavre district. Among the six accused is Agni Sapkota, a senior member of the party. In 2008 the Supreme Court ordered Kavre police to register a case against the accused. In 2009 Kavre police told Advocacy Forum that they were unable to locate and arrest Sapkota in the district. He was a member of Nepal’s Constitituent Assembly at the time. He later became speaker of the House of Representatives from 2020-2022.

Numerous cases under terrorism-related laws have been withdrawn. Since these were largely lodged against Maoist fighters and alleged supporters, after they joined mainstream politics, the Maoists campaigned to have such cases dropped. The Maoist-led government, in October 2008, announced a blanket withdrawal of 349 cases. On November 17, 2009, the Madhav Kumar Nepal’s UML-led government retracted 282 cases.

In January 2020, the Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is prime minister at the time of writing, said of the deaths caused by the war, “The then state killed 12,000 people. If you hold me responsible for the killing of 5,000 persons, I am ready to accept it.” The Maoists have appointed individuals accused of serious crimes to office. However, pending cases have caused worry among Maoist leaders over the risk that they might face prosecution abroad under universal jurisdiction.

Universal Jurisdiction

National judicial officials around the world can investigate and prosecute those implicated in serious international crimes, under the principle of “universal jurisdiction.” This principle allows authorities in a third country to prosecute individuals believed to be responsible for certain grave international crimes even though they were committed abroad and neither the accused nor the victims are nationals of that country.

Col. Kumar Lama was arrested in the United Kingdom in 2013 and prosecuted for crimes of torture which allegedly occurred in Nepal during the conflict. Nepal refused to cooperate with the UK investigation. Although Lama was acquitted of the charges against him, with the jury failing to reach a verdict on one count, the UK proceedings had an impact in Nepal, giving fresh impetus to victims’ demands for justice and making clear to the authorities that international justice is a realistic prospect.

VI. The Latest Transitional Justice Bill

On July 15, 2022, a coalition government led by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba presented a Bill for the Amendment of the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, 2071 (2014) to parliament. The bill was drafted in belated response to the Supreme Court’s 2015 ruling (upheld in 2020) that the transitional justice act should be amended. The bill contained several provisions that were welcomed by victims’ groups and human rights activists, but still required significant amendments to comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling and international legal obligations. It was not adopted before parliament was dissolved ahead of elections later that year.

On March 19, 2023, the newly elected coalition government led by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal tabled a nearly identical bill in parliament, which addressed some of the weaknesses that had been identified in the earlier version. At the time of writing that bill remains before parliament.

The bill includes several positive provisions. It guarantees the right to reparation (although it does not detail the reparation process), as well as interim relief for some victims who were left out of earlier relief packages. It also guarantees the right of the families of victims of enforced disappearance to their relative’s property. It mandates the TRC to study the root causes and impact of the conflict and recommend institutional reforms.

However, the bill still includes numerous provisions that would prevent accountability for serious crimes under international law. Under the proposals, the TRC and CIEDP would act as the sole investigation bodies in conflict-era crimes, and cases classified as “serious violations of human rights” could be referred to and prosecuted in a special court. However, the definition of “serious violations of human rights” – which includes rape and “serious sexual violence,” enforced disappearance, “cruel or inhuman torture,” and a definition of unlawful killings which is yet to be agreed by politicians, provided that the offence was committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community”– excludes numerous serious crimes under international law, including crimes against combatants, some instances of torture, arbitrary killings which may be war crimes, and some systematic violations which may amount to crimes against humanity, creating a significant accountability gap. Crimes against combatants are excluded.

The bill in its current form defines “violations of human rights” (other than those it terms “serious”) as “acts against the domestic law, international human rights law or humanitarian law, committed during the armed conflict in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community.” Because this category of crimes is excluded from prosecution, this means that alleged perpetrators of some serious human rights violations and grave crimes under international law, including some crimes against humanity or war crimes, would receive de facto amnesties. Amnesties for serious crimes are contrary to international law and standards, and raise serious concerns for victims. Once again, crimes in this category must be committed “in a targeted or planned manner against an unarmed individual or community”, meaning non-targeted or unplanned actions and crimes against combatants would fall outside the scope of the entire process, including for the purpose of reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence.

There are other shortcomings in the bill, including:

It fails to clarify how the principle of non-retroactivity of criminal law would apply in a manner consistent with international law. International law requires the prosecution of certain serious crimes, such as torture and enforced disappearance, if warranted by evidence, irrespective of whether they were crimes under domestic law when they were committed, given they have long been recognized as crimes under international law. Prosecuting war crimes and crimes against humanity for conduct prior to their codification as crimes in domestic law does not violate the principle of non-retroactivity when these were already crimes under international law. As Article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states: No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.… [However, n]othing in this article shall prejudice the trial and punishment of any person for any act or omission which, at the time when it was committed, was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations.

It fails to clarify which “applicable law” would be used to prosecute those involved in serious crimes. The Penal Code, which came into force in 2018, prevents retroactive applicability of its provisions. Moreover, the Penal Code includes statutory limitations for the crimes of rape, torture, and enforced disappearances.

It empowers the government to appoint judges on the special court “in consultation with the Judicial Council”, not through the independent process required by Nepal’s Constitution.

It does not provide any mechanism to ensure the financial independence of the transitional justice bodies.

In a 13-page communication sent to the government of Nepal on June 9, 2023, four UN human rights experts welcomed “some positive aspects introduced by the Bill, such as … examin[ing] the root causes of the conflict and recommending institutional reform, as well as guaranteeing victims’ right to reparation.” But they warned adopting it would “place Nepal in contravention of its international human rights obligation to investigate and punish serious human rights violations, as well as the ruling of the Supreme Court.”

Proposed Amendments to the Bill

The government, under pressure to address the shortcomings of the bill, established a parliamentary sub-committee on May 19, 2023. The result of its deliberations became public in October 2023.

Several of the sub-committee’s proposals – if they are adopted – would help to partially address some of the concerns that had been raised. For example, it proposed:

To include “serious” forms of sexual violence under the category of serious violations requiring prosecution.

To make it possible for victims not satisfied with the reparation awarded to appeal in the Special Court.

To extend the tenure of the commissions from two years to four years.

To establish specialized units within the TRC to investigate cases involving sexual violence.

To provide an extra three-month window for sexual violence survivors to register cases, and to remedy the problem of statutory limitations in rape cases.

However, the proposed amendments do not fully address several important shortcomings, including those described above. It would remain the case that only crimes defined as “serious human rights violations” may be prosecuted, despite the fact that the current definition excludes some war crimes and crimes against humanity which, contrary to international law, would therefore be subject to amnesties. Crimes committed against combatants are excluded from both categories of violations. This means that they would not only be excluded from accountability, but also reparations or any other consideration by the TRC.

For violations not defined as “serious,” amnesties would be granted. The bill includes a provision requiring those receiving an amnesty to fulfil certain conditions, such as disclosing the truth, making an apology to victims, or paying compensation, and amnesty can be granted only with the consent of the victims. However, no provision exists to prosecute those cases not defined as “serious” where victims do not give consent, or the perpetrator fails to fulfil the conditions. In effect, alleged perpetrators of abduction, mutilations, beatings, and other crimes would be granted an automatic amnesty, although such violations could amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes. Amnesties for serious crimes are contrary to international law and standards, raising serious concerns for victims.

The status under the bill of the crime of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary killings was not settled by the sub-committee but left open for further discussion.

The proposed amendments offer a three-month window for survivors of sexual violence who have not registered their case to do so, but this period is far too short.

The sub-committee does not call to ensure the financial independence of the transitional justice bodies. According to a recent report by the special rapporteur on the promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, transparent funding that provides sufficient material and human resources, is key to guaranteeing the independence of transitional justice mechanisms.[118]

Important issues where the sub-committee attempted to but was not able to make a recommendation to address acknowledged weaknesses in the bill include:

The definition of unlawful killings to be included under the category of “serious human rights violations” that cannot receive amnesties.

Mechanisms for redress and reparations.

The system to handle cases where victims and perpetrators do not agree to be reconciled.

The method of calculating leniency in sentencing. While public debate and human rights activism have helped to introduce improvements to the bill, and there is important progress towards adopting a long overdue law on transitional justice, the draft law and amendment process do not currently comply with the rulings of the Supreme Court, international legal standards, or the demands of many victims. If it is passed without necessary strengthening, the law would risk hindering the search for justice in Nepal, unravelling in the Supreme Court, and once again setting the process back by years.

To uphold the rights of victims, and to protect all Nepalis by strengthening the rule of law and adopting measures to ensure the non-recurrence of violations, the transitional justice bill should be appropriately amended and then passed into law.

In India, we can observe how nationalism is a political ideology that holds devotion to one’s country as paramount to all other concerns. It was not until the late 18th century that nationalism became a widely acknowledged sentiment shaping public and private life and one of the great, if not the greatest, single determining factors of modern history, though people have always felt a solid connection to their native countries, their parents, and their governments. When the British ruled India, there was economic backwardness, repressive colonial policies, socio-religious reform movements and the influence of western education which led to the rise of nationalism. This spirit of nationalism shaped the anti-colonial movement under the leadership of mainly the Congress that forced the Britishers to quit India. Hindu-Muslim unity was an important plank of the movement inspired by nationalism.

Hinduism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent, which survived the onslaught of religions of various invaders, unlike some other parts of the world which converted en masse to a foreign religion. In contrast, Hindutva is an ideology working towards establishing the hegemony of the Hindus and Hinduism and has given rise to a new concept of nationalism conflating with majoritarian religious hegemony. Hindutva has also been present in the Nepalese monarchy. As aspirations for democratization grew around the close of the 20th century, the rulers aggressively embraced Hindutva to maintain public support and authority.

After the British Raj was overthrown in 1947, India adopted a new constitution inspired by the ideal of nationalism very thoughtfully cultivated by the Congress that created a secular republic with what has been called a “principled distance” rather than the strict church-state separation seen in many Western democracies. India decided to exhibit tolerance for the country’s many different religious sects without giving any one sect preferential treatment.

Both the ideas of Indian nationalism described above are dedicated to India’s sovereign geographical limits, but they disagree beyond that. Secular nationalism combines geographical integrity with the cultural concept of political pluralism. In contrast, Hindu nationalism combines territorial unity with Hindutva, or the view that India is primarily a state by, for, and of the Hindu population.

Hindu nationalism, as it is known now, may be dated to the 1920s, when Savarkar started to emphasize the significance of aligning India’s geographical and cultural/religious limits with the European nation-state. Savarkar saw Hindutva as a geographical, ethnic, and cultural community. Savarkar’s motto, “Hindu, Hindi, Hindustan,” mirrored European-style nationalism based on religious identification, common language and racial unity. His notion of Indian nationalism emphasized loyalty to the Hindu nation. The Hindu unity, divided by caste and civic character, was strengthened by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). In 1925 RSS was formed by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar for the sole motive of uniting Hindu society (read promotion of Hindutva). BJP as the ruling party of India is currently pursuing this agenda. It has taken up religious issues like cows protection by banning selling and consuming beef, while directly targeting the Muslims and going to the extent of mob lynching any Muslim suspected of being involved in bovine trade or having consumed beef. Narendra Modi’s rise was accompanied by his hard stance against Muslims in Gujarat especially during the 2002 communal violence, building this brand of Hindu nationalism and projecting him as its most strident leader. This aggression was directed not merely against Muslims living in India but also against Pakistan. Even before taking over as PM, in 2002 Gujarat state assembly elections he was targeting President Musharraf in his election speeches and posters.

In 2019 as PM he undertook Balakot ‘surgical’ strike in response to killing of 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in Pulwama attack and secured the return of Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman who was captured by Pakistan in an air raid and bolstered his image as a strong Hindutva leader, evoking spirit of nationalism among Indians, which also helped him win the election soon after.

Even though it was a Supreme Court decision which paved the way for building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, after demolition of Babri mosque, which stood at the same place, by Hindutva activists described as a criminal act by the same SC judgement, Narendra Modi very shrewdly projected it as an achievement of his government thereby fulfilling a long held promise of his party, further consolidating his image as a Hindu nationalist leader. The political project of demolition of mosque and building a temple at its place has been given the colour of nationalist pride.

The politics of Hindutva nationalism may have helped BJP rise to power and maintain a grip over it but in the process has destroyed the values and spirit assiduously built over the freedom struggle which informed the making of the Constitution of India.

When a Bhartiya Janata Party Member of Parliament Ramesh Bidhuri can openly abuse a Muslim colleague Danish Ali in parliament we can imagine how insecure the minorities must be feeling under the present dispensation. Muslims and Christians have been particularly at the receiving end of a sustained obnoxious disparaging campaign by Hindutva activists, organizations and sometimes the BJP governments too. Bulldozer has become a symbol of this intimidation and is often selectively used against political opponents. A report released by India Hate Lab, Washington DC, has documented 668 cases of hate speech against religious minorities, 75% of which took place in BJP ruled states. In most cases no action was taken against the culprits. With a Uniform Civil Code of Uttarakhand Bill approved by the state Assembly, now India is a queer case where hate remains unpunished and love is punishable.

Talking about Nepal, few things ignite the nationalist fire more quickly than the perception or reality of an adversary from outside. Beyond matters of national sovereignty, Nepal’s national purity—the last bastion of what King Prithvi Narayan Shah had proudly referred to as “Asal Hindusthan” (the pure land of Hindus) —was at stake in the portrayal of British India as an invading, creeping bogeyman. As a consequence, the purity of national sovereignty was also upheld by keeping Nepal an untainted Hindu realm free of Muslim and British contamination.

Hindutva has also been present in the monarchy in more recent times. As aspirations for democratization grew around the close of the 20th century, the rulers aggressively embraced Hindutva to maintain public support and authority. Their deification as a direct reincarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu was possibly the most blatant example of this tactic. In direct contrast to secular India in the south, the monarchy aggressively began to promote Nepal as the last Hindu country in the world in the 1960s. They started fostering cultural relations with the Hindu right in India, often to the displeasure of the ruling authorities. Hindu nationalism had an unquestionable impact on the creation of Nepal’s final constitution in 2015. Even today’s de jure secularism in Nepal is under doubt. For secularism has been defined as the state supporting Sanatan faiths, or religions practiced since ancient times. Many activists and minority populations opposed the constitution’s language.

The recently ousted prime minister of Nepal, Khadga Prasad Oli, represented the growing influence of Hindutva politics in Nepal, when he controversially said that Lord Ram was born in Nepal rather than India in 2020. Hinduism is a holy religion in Nepal. It has had a revered history of giving comfort and purpose to millions of lives in Nepal for hundreds of years. It still has a strong presence in modern-day Nepali society. However, throughout Nepal’s history, tyrants and despots have used Hindu nationalism to achieve their political objectives. The core factor contributing to Nepal’s rising rate of religious conversion is discrimination based on caste. As a result, there has been a rise in Hindu religious activity, temple building, and public religious ritual organization.

Unlike in India, social justice movements founded on the concepts of Ambedkar and Periyar have not undermined the Hindu caste system in Nepal. The Asal Hindusthan narrative of Nepal is still being promoted by legislators and judges.For King Mahendra, the 11th King of Nepal, nationalism was one language, one nation, and one religion. The word “Hindu Kingdom” was added by King Mahendra to the constitution of Nepal, boosting the confidence of Hindus in India and across the globe.

Nepal should be at ease and confident that its identity as a nation with a Hindu majority would not be challenged, rather than being consumed with an unrealistic desire to be the only Hindu state in the world at the cost of religious minorities. The most prominent religion is “more equal” than others, notwithstanding secularism. The President closely attends important Hindu celebrations, and extra holidays are observed on Hindu festivals in addition to limitations on cow slaughter and religious conversion.

Hence, both in India and Nepal the Hindtuva ideology has become or remained a challenge to the concept of an egalitarian society based on the principles of secularism and socialism.

The secular societies of India and Nepal stand in contrast to United Arab Emirates which has recently built a Hindu temple near Abu Dhabi, thereby conveying a message of communal harmony, which seems to have become an anathema in South Asia.

Leaders from the UML and Maoist Center, ready for a fresh alliance, have also begun talks with Madhav Kumar Nepal. Following a meeting with PM Dahal on Monday and another with UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and his team on Tuesday, discussions expanded to include other parties starting Wednesday morning.

On Wednesday morning, NC President Deuba asked the chairman of CPN (Unified Socialist) Nepal to go together. ""Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal betrayed us. He betrayed not only the coalition but also the country. Let us meet and form a new equation,"" the source said, quoting Deuba's proposal to Nepal.

On Wednesday morning, NC President Deuba reached out to CPN (Unified Socialist) Chairman Nepal. “Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal betrayed us; he betrayed not only the coalition but also the nation. Let’s come together and form a new alliance,"" the source said, quoting Deuba's proposal to Nepal.

During the meeting, Deuba also offered the PM’s position to Nepal. “Let us take Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) along, and you become the prime minister, I will support you,"" the source said, quoting Deuba's statement.

Sources claim that Deuba also presented the possible arithmetic in parliament that could form an alternative alliance. Ramesh Lekhak was also present along with Deuba. Nepal, on the other hand, said that since the party's secretariat was going to hold a meeting, a conclusion would be drawn from that meeting.

The source said, quoting Nepal's statement, ""The secretariat meeting is being held today and we will announce our party's views from there."" Mohan Gautam, Nepal's personal secretary and central member of CPN-US, said that there was a general discussion between the two leaders about the current political situation.

On Tuesday night, PM Dahal and CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli also visited Nepal’s residence and asked him to participate in the government. The CPN-US has called a central secretariat meeting today to decide whether or not to participate in the government of the new coalition, but Nepal has already agreed on the formation of a left-wing coalition.

In the meeting of the three parties held on Tuesday evening in Koteshwor, the residence of Nepal, it was agreed to form a left alliance to defeat extremists in the country as they are trying to ruin the country in the name of religion. The leaders agreed to form a coalition until the 2084 elections.

But the NC has also started meeting with the leaders of the political parties in order to foil the ‘deception’ by the Maoists. The NC has withdrawn its support after the alliance broke up. NC ministers from all provinces have resigned to facilitate government formation by the new alliance. ""The NC has also presented the mathematics of an alternative alliance to Madhav Nepal,"" the source said.

If Deuba can prevent Nepal's 10 seats from going to the UML-Maoist coalition, then adding the 87 seats of NC, 14 of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), 10 of CPN-US, 6 of Janamat, 4 of Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP) and 4 seats of Nagarik Unmukti Party (NUP) will make 125 seats and if Rabi Lamichhane’s RSP can be brought into it, a comfortable majority will be achieved, the source said.","{'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/default_image_1280x720.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709617923_yumyum-1200x560_20240305180737.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709707795_samajbadischiwalaya-1200x560_20240306153413.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-nagarik.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/PLANE_20230727144957.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/google.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-purbeli.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-paschameli.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Sheetal_Niwas.jpg', 'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/Nepali-Congress-Feb3.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Pathivara_20201018114959.jpg', 'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/chin-kaji-shrestha.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/MaoNing_20240306124634.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/CPN-UML_20220523122151.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=KvIUm1aMp4Z3WR', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709713199_raswapa-1200x560_20240306145146.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/barshamanPun_20211126132319.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/logo-login.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/LumbiniProvincialAssembly_20210902121301.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/my-city/image/mycity-logo.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/left-alliance_Feb13.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/app-design.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709700088_deuwaaaa-1200x560_20240306122623.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709715907_thapaliyapatrisiameet-1200x560_20240306161947.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/logo.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/shareincrease_20220215172520.jpeg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Arrest_20210131094327.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/myrepublica-logo11.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-shukrabar.png'}","काठमांडू, 6 मार्च : नेपाली कांग्रेस (एनसी) के साथ गठबंधन के भंग करै के आरू सीपीएन-यूएमएल के साथ नया गठबंधन के गढ़ै के फैसला के कारण नेपाली कांग्रेस (एनसी) के अध्यक्ष आरू पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री शेर के साथ एगो नया गठबंधन के निर्माण के फैसला के कारण बहादुर देउबा सीपीएन (एकीकृत समाजवादी) के अध्यक्ष माधव कुमार नेपाल के पीएम के पद के पेशकश |ताजा गठबंधन के लेल तैयार यूएमएल आ माओवादी केंद्र के नेता सेहो माधव कुमार नेपाल सं बातचीत शुरू क देने छथिन्ह.सोमदिन पीएम दाहल के साथ बैठक के बाद आरू मंगलवार क॑ यूएमएल के अध्यक्ष केपी शर्मा ओली आरू हुनकऽ टीम के साथ एगो आरू चर्चा के विस्तार होय गेलै आरू बुधवार के सुबह स॑ शुरू होय वाला अन्य दलऽ क॑ शामिल करलऽ गेलै ।बुधदिन भोर मे एनसी के अध्यक्ष देउबा सीपीएन (यूनिफाइड सोशलिस्ट) नेपाल के अध्यक्ष सं एक संग जेबाक लेल कहलनि।नेपाल के देल गेल दौबा के प्रस्ताव के उद्धरण दैत सूत्र कहलनि जे, प्रधान मंत्री पुष्पा कमल दहल हमरा सब के संग धोखा केलनि। ओ गठबंधन के मात्र नहि बल्कि देश के संग सेहो धोखा देलनि। आउ, एकटा नव समीकरण सं भेंट करी।बुधदिन भोर मे एनसी के अध्यक्ष देउबा सीपीएन (यूनिफाइड सोशलिस्ट) के अध्यक्ष नेपाल सं संपर्क केलनि।“प्रधान मंत्री पुष्पा कमल दहल हमरा लोकनि केँ धोखा देलनि;ओ गठबंधन पर मात्र नहि अपितु राष्ट्र के संग धोखा केलनि।आउ, एक संग आबि एकटा नव गठबंधन बनाबी,&quot;

The telephonic conversation, which was scheduled to discuss issues such as the return of the bodies of Nepalis who have joined the Russian army, and the return of the bodies of Nepalis who were killed in the Ukraine war, and compensation, have been thrown into confusion due to the change in the power alliance in Nepal.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) has said that homework is being done on this matter. Spokesperson for the Ministry, Joint Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai said that the Prime Minister's Office has been informed about this matter and preparations are being made for the talks as per the predetermined time.

“The time for the telephone conversation between our minister and his Russian counterpart has been decided. Homework is being done after discussing this matter with the Prime Minister's Office, said Spokesperson Rai.

After long efforts by the MoFA and the Nepali Embassy in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei is scheduled to hold a telephone conversation with his Nepali counterpart on March 7 (tomorrow). Foreign Minister NP Saud, who expressed his desire to go to Russia himself to discuss this matter, had been trying to hold a dialogue with his counterpart Lavrov for a long time.

For that, Saud had advanced the process through the Russian Embassy in Nepal and the Nepali Embassy in Moscow. However, Russia was not ready to welcome him and at the last moment it was ready for telephone talks.

After the time was fixed for the telephone conversation, the talks fell into confusion after Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal dismissed the Foreign Minister due to a change in the alliance.

A few days ago, a time was fixed for bilateral telephone talks on issues such as the safe return of Nepalis in the Russian army, treatment of the injured, relief to the family members of those who have lost their lives, and stopping the recruitment of Nepalis into the Russian Army.

Nepal has been requesting its citizens not to join the Russian army, asking those who have already joined to return home, send the dead bodies to Nepal and provide details of those who have been mutilated as well as provide them with compensation. But till now, Nepal is not able to communicate these concerns directly to Russia.

During his visit to Uganda, Foreign Minister Saud requested Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin on this matter and also called the Russian Ambassador in Nepal and requested him.

According to the information sent by the Russian Ministry of Defense to the Government of Nepal, 12 Nepali people working in the Russian army have died so far. Apart from that, Nepal has no information about the remaining number of Nepalis working in the Russian Army and their situation.

At the consular department under the MoFA, more than 200 families have submitted requests for rescue.

In addition, only a short time ago, Russia was ready to provide compensation to the families of Nepalis who were killed in the war with Ukraine through the embassy. While they were saying that the family members of the deceased can get compensation only after reaching Russia, after the initiative of the MoFA, Russia was ready to provide compensation through the embassy.","{'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709617923_yumyum-1200x560_20240305180737.jpg',

The woman has been travelling around the world, along with her husband, on motorcycles, for the last six years. The couple told reporters that they would continue their world tour, before leaving for Nepal via Bihar. The 28-year-old woman said that she has no complaints against the people of India as she had safely travelled around 20,000 km across the country in the last six months. She was allegedly gang-raped at Kurumahat, around 300 km from the state capital Ranchi, when she was spending the night in a tent along with her husband. The seven men allegedly barged into their tent and assaulted the husband before raping the woman.

""We chose the place for the night stay because it was calm and beautiful. We thought it would be okay if we lived there alone,"" she said. The woman said that she would continue her tour along with her husband. ""I want to tell some people, especially girls, to coach themselves to face such situations. I know it's hard and it's not easy. You don't forget, but you have to keep trying to leave it in the past,"" she said. Dumka's Superintendent of Police Pitamber Singh Kherwar said the couple left for Bihar, from where they will enter Nepal. Three people have been arrested so far, and a search is on for the remaining four accused, police said.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has held several meetings with opposition leader K P Oli of the UML over the past few months because he knew that the bill could not be passed without UML support.

Dahal was under pressure from the international community, including from United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres during his visit to Nepal in October to conclude the transitional justice process. On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the group Advocacy Forum-Nepal released a report that said although the Nepal government’s proposed bill on transitional justice contains positive provisions, but needs ‘significant amendments’.

‘It is widely recognised that a lack of accountability for conflict-era violations has led to a crisis of impunity in Nepal, with police and politicians rarely held accountable for rights violations and corruption,’ the two organisations said in a statement.

But they added that the current moment presents the opportunity to amend the draft so that the demands of victims and survivors of the 1996-2006 conflict are met. More than 17,000 Nepalis, mostly civilians, were killed and some 3,288 are still listed as missing.

HRW said that the work of rights activists had ensured built public pressure to improve the draft bill, but it still allowed those responsible for serious war crimes and crimes against humanity to not be answerable.

The HRW Advocacy Forum report, Breaking Barriers to Justice: Nepal’s Long Struggle for Accountability, Truth and Reparations analyses the proposed law and reviews some cases where there were obstructions to justice by the Nepali state, which is made up of the former enemies in the conflict.

Survivors of war rape and relatives of victims filed complaints in 62 extrajudicial killings, and the organisations say that the draft does not meet international legal standards, rulings by Nepal’s Supreme Court and demands of victims’ families.

“To deliver a durable and rights-respecting process without further delay, Nepal’s leaders should agree to amendments called for by victims and recommended by legal experts, then ask parliament to pass the bill into law,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, HRW’s deputy Asia director. ""This is a moment of opportunity to deliver the truth, justice, and reparations long sought by victims and help protect the rights of all Nepalis in the future.""

The conflict ended 18 years ago with the signing of the 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement under which mandated setting up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a Commission on the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP).

During Secretary-General Guterres’ visit Prime Minister Dahal from the Maoist Centre party promised ‘speedy advancement’ of the peace process. The current bill provides for reparations and interim relief for some victims, including victims of torture and rape, who were left out of earlier relief packages. It guarantees the right of the families of victims of enforced disappearance to their relatives’ property.

The TRC and (CIEDP) would investigate war crimes and those classified as ‘serious violations of human rights’ could be referred to and prosecuted in a special court. This includes rape, enforced disappearance, and cruel or inhuman torture, and a yet to be finalised definition of unlawful killing.

However, HRW says the bill excludes numerous serious crimes under international law, including some acts of torture and other unlawful killings. It says excluding certain categories of crime risks providing general amnesty to perpetrators, as well as deprive some victims and their families from reparations.

“If the transitional justice bill is passed without appropriate amendments, it risks hindering the search for justice,” said Bikash Basnet of Advocacy Forum. “If it is appropriately amended, it can be the basis for a meaningful, nationally-owned process that upholds the rights of victims and benefits all Nepalis by strengthening institutions and the rule of law.”

Nepal: delivering winter tents to earthquake-affected families - European Union,Nepal: delivering winter tents to earthquake-affected families  European Union,2024-03-06 11:11:20,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL2NpdmlsLXByb3RlY3Rpb24taHVtYW5pdGFyaWFuLWFpZC5lYy5ldXJvcGEuZXUvbmV3cy1zdG9yaWVzL3N0b3JpZXMvbmVwYWwtZGVsaXZlcmluZy13aW50ZXItdGVudHMtZWFydGhxdWFrZS1hZmZlY3RlZC1mYW1pbGllc19lbtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu,European Union,"Being one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries, Nepal is no stranger to natural hazards, including earthquakes.

In early November 2023, a powerful earthquake shook western Nepal, leaving behind a trail of destruction. Tens of thousands of homes were damaged as the country was bracing for bitterly cold winter months.

The European Union allocated €2 million to help partners deliver vital aid to the quake-hit communities. The package included tents and winterisation kits from its European Humanitarian Response Capacity (EHRC) to make sure people stay warm while restoring their lives.

On 3 November 2023, a strong 6.4-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal’s western province of Karnali, causing heavy losses and serious damage to nearby villages. The tremor was followed by over 400 aftershocks, including one of 5.8 magnitude. © European Union, 2023

The quake claimed over 150 lives and left more than 250,000 people in need of assistance, including some 30,000 whose homes were damaged or destroyed. © European Union, 2023

“There was nothing left of what we called home when we came back,” recalls 28-year-old Laxmi. Along with her 18-month-old son Roshan, she was away the night the major tremor hit. “We had no place to stay, and it was getting very cold.” © Save the Children, 2023

“After the earthquake, we had to live in a small goat shed, fearing to stay inside our home with deep cracks,” remembers 32-year-old Sita, a mother of 3 whose house was reduced to rubble. “We shivered all night without warm clothes and blankets.” © Save the Children, 2024

To ensure affected people can make it through Nepal’s harsh winter, especially children, pregnant and lactating mothers and the elderly, the EU distributed winter tents to communities in 11 far-flung areas, in partnership with Save the Children. © European Union, 2023

In a big logistics effort, 7 flights brought in-kind contributions from EU stocks in Kuala Lumpur to Kathmandu. The materials were then delivered by trucks to affected towns in the west. © European Union, 2023

Through the EU-supported initiative, a total of 800 tents have been provided to vulnerable families in the worst-hit districts of Jajarkot and West Rukum. These fireproof, waterproof, stove-equipped tents are spacious enough for a family of 5. © Save the Children, 2023

""The tent has brought immense relief,” says Sita. “Now, my children can stay warm. It shields us from dew and dampness, and we can eat inside. Most importantly, it has provided us with some stability,” says Sita. © Save the Children, 2024

“The tents have been of great benefit to us,” says Laxmi. “It’s been so much easier to keep Roshan warm, his health is improving, and we feel safe inside.” © Save the Children,

Nepal's owl conservation efforts showcased in Houston - Annapurna Express,Nepal's owl conservation efforts showcased in Houston  Annapurna Express,2024-03-06 11:12:31,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYW5uYXB1cm5hZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vc3RvcnkvNDc4Mjkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,https://theannapurnaexpress.com,Annapurna Express,"A- A+

The 22nd International Festival of Owls was held in Houston, Minnesota, in the United States from March 1-3.

The festival was originally started in 2003 to commemorate the first hatching by a Great Horned Owl named Alice, which was rescued with a broken wing and was unable to survive in the wild.

“Alice fell from her nest when she was just three months old. She is still under our care,” Karla Bloem, the director of the International Owl Center, said.

Rescued owls from seven different species, including Great Horned Owls, Snowy Owls, and Barn Owls, who are unable to survive in the wild, were put on display at the festival to raise awareness about the need for owl conservation.

Researchers, scientists, conservation activists, among others, from different countries made presentations on different aspects of owls during the festival. To better launch awareness about owl conservation, the organizers also organized a competition among kids to produce owl sounds and several other events.

Dr Martin Salek, a little owl researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Biology under the Czech Academy of Sciences, spoke on the importance of owls and their conservation. Likewise, Dr Roar Solheim, a researcher from Norway, made a presentation on the importance and identity of owls.

An art exhibition on owls showcasing creations of over 4,000 artists from 33 different countries was one of the major attractions of the festival. Several posters and banners related to owl conservation were exhibited inside and outside the event venue.

According to the organizers, the festival saw the participation of over 3,000 people ranging from students to researchers and the elderly.

Douglas Thompson (79), one of the participants of the festival, said the festival was helping in the promotion of ecotourism and the conservation of different birds and wildlife species.

Nepal has also been holding conservation festivals to raise awareness for the conservation of owls. A two-day Npeal Owl Festival was organized at Lek Phant in Jaljala Rural Municipality of Parbat district last month. A documentary on owl conservation was exhibited during the festival. The festival is being organized by an organization named Friends of Nature.

Photo and video exhibition

An exhibition of a photo story related to the rescue of three different species of owls by journalist and conservation activist Krishna Mani Baral was also organized during the International Owl Festival.

Likewise, a documentary showcasing Nepal’s ecological diversity, ecotourism, owl conservation, and activities of the Nepal Owl Festival was also shown during the event.

Speaking on the occasion, Baral said festivals like these are becoming effective in raising awareness about owl conservation. “Nepal may be a small country in terms of geography.

The 50-page report published on Tuesday highlights the importance of revisions to ensure justice for survivors and victims of the country's civil war. Despite improvements in the bill, concerns remain over its ability to address serious crimes and provide reparations.

“To deliver a durable and rights respecting process without further delay, Nepal’s leaders should agree to amendments called for by victims and recommended by legal experts then ask parliament to pass the bill into law,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “This is a moment of opportunity to deliver the truth, justice and reparations long sought by victims, and help protect the rights of all Nepalis in the future.”

The proposed law, aimed at addressing decades-long struggles for justice, faces criticism for potentially shielding perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It also risks denying some victims access to reparations. Amendments are urged to meet victims' needs and international legal standards.

While the bill includes provisions for reparations and interim relief, it excludes numerous serious crimes under international law, creating an accountability gap. Additionally, concerns arise over the independence and financial autonomy of transitional justice bodies, as well as the registration window for survivors of sexual violence.

Nepal's international partners are urged to support a process that meets legal standards, with donor support delivered transparently and independently. Human Rights Watch and Advocacy Forum emphasize the importance of a meaningful, nationally owned process that upholds victims' rights and strengthens institutions and the rule of law.

“If the transitional justice bill is passed without appropriate amendments, it risks hindering the search for justice,” said Bikash Banet, director of Advocacy Forum. “If it is appropriately amended, it can be the basis for a meaningful, nationally owned process that upholds the rights of victims and benefits all Nepalis by strengthening institutions and the rule of law.”","{'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/1709715907_thapaliyapatrisiameet-1200x560_20240306161947.jpg',

Indigenous women have cultivated a symbiotic relationship with nature, its resources, and the surrounding landscape from time immemorial. They persist in practicing traditional livelihoods, preserving ancestral knowledge, and skills, upholding cultural values, and engaging in sustainable management of natural resources, biodiversity, and climate action.

A two-day “Pre-Validation Regional Workshop on Indigenous Women’s Knowledge and Perspectives in Climate Action” was organized on 19-20 February 2024 by the Centre for Indigenous Peoples’ Research and Development (CIPRED) in Banke district of Nepal. Supported by UN Women, the workshop brought together over 60 participants including Indigenous women, youth, local government, and communities from East Rukum, Bardiya, and Darchula districts. Inaugurated in the presence of the Chief Guest, Honorable Rina Rana, a member of the Indigenous Nationalities Commission, the workshop presented and discussed the initial findings of the study on Indigenous women’s knowledge on climate action in Nepal, conducted in early 2024.

Group discussions and presentations ensued on various themes including climate change, Indigenous food, herbal medicine, handicrafts, enterprises, and the transmission of Indigenous knowledge to younger generations.

The primary aim of the workshop was to divulge the initial findings of the study on the roles and contributions of Indigenous women in climate action in the study area. Furthermore, it aimed to solicit valuable feedback on these findings from key respondents and stakeholders, including local government representatives, Indigenous organizations, and community elders and leaders. ""Young Tharu women often lack awareness about the importance of our traditional knowledge, cultural values, rituals, and festivals. Working as an enumerator, I've gained insight and appreciation for the opportunity to safeguard our cultural values. I hope other youth from my community can also access similar opportunities, fostering intergenerational knowledge and values transfer,"" said Ms. Surakshya Chaudhary, a Tharu Indigenous Youth from Bardiya and a graduate student of Rural Development, who worked on the research.

The event also included an exhibition showcasing indigenous seeds, food, plants, and traditional handicrafts from Tharu, Magar, Gurung, and Byansi Sauka Indigenous communities. Moreover, participants engaged in a collage display session, arranging pictures from each community into various themes to provide insights into the present situation of their villages.

""We are not informed about any funds or activities in our communities; therefore, we are rarely involved in project activities, and representation of Sauka women is hardly there at the local level,"" explained during the event Ms. Manju Budhathoki, a Sauka Indigenous woman and member of Byansi Sauka Samaj.

The workshop culminated with closing remarks by Mr. Tej Bahadur Bhat, Mayor of Madhuwan Municipality, Bardiya who underscored the significance of preserving indigenous cultural values, skills, and practices, emphasizing their continuity through younger generations. Overall, the two-day workshop witnessed active participation from Indigenous women and youth, fostering substantial discussions and providing valuable inputs to the research study.","{'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/footer-facebook_3.png?t=1642408405', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/footer-youtube_2.png?t=1642408405', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/footer-twitter_2.png?t=1642408405', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2021-05/footer-instagram_5.png?t=1642408405', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2023-12/UN-Women-logo-blue-en.png?t=1702303494', 'https://asiapacific.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/np-c675-cipred-photo01-1679px-r02.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/np-c675-Group-discussion-1679px.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/np-c675-Indigenous-Women-from-Darchula-1679px.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2023-11/unw-logo-footer-en.png?t=1700165802', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2022-09/footer-linkedin_16-ap.png?t=1663298757', 'https://news.google.com/sites/default/files/2024-03/np-c675-cipred-photo01-1679px-r02.jpg'}","लेखक : संघाशा पंता आदिवासी महिला सब प्रकृति, ओकर संसाधन, आ आसपास के परिदृश्य के संग एकटा सहजीवी संबंध के खेती केने छथि |इ पारंपरिक आजीविका कें अभ्यास, पैतृक ज्ञान कें संरक्षण, आ कौशल, सांस्कृतिक मूल्यक कें पालन, आ प्राकृतिक संसाधनक, जैव विविधता, आ जलवायु कार्य कें टिकाऊ प्रबंधन मे संलग्न रहय मे कायम छै.नेपाल केरऽ बैंके जिला म॑ आदिवासी लोगऽ के अनुसंधान आरू विकास (सीआईपीआईडीईडीईडी) न॑ १९-२० फरवरी २०२४ क॑ दू दिन के “उपयोगी महिला ज्ञान आरू परिप्रेक्ष्य प॑ पूर्व-मान्यता क्षेत्रीय कार्यशाला” के आयोजन करलऽ गेलऽ छेलै ।संयुक्त राष्ट्र महिला सिनी के समर्थन स॑ ई कार्यशाला म॑ पूर्वी रूकुम, बरदिया, आरू डार्चुला जिला केरऽ आदिवासी महिला, युवा, स्थानीय सरकार, आरू समुदाय सहित ६० स॑ अधिक प्रतिभागी क॑ एक साथ लानलऽ गेलऽ छेलै ।मुख्य अतिथि, स्वदेशी राष्ट्रीयता आयोग के सदस्य के मुख्य अतिथि के उपस्थिति में उद्घाटन, कार्यशाला में 2024 के प्रारंभ में संचालित नेपाल में जलवायु कार्यवाही के बारे में आदिवासी महिलाओं के ज्ञान पर अध्ययन के प्रारंभिक निष्कर्षों के प्रस्तुत और चर्चा की गई | जलवायु परिवर्तन, स्वदेशी भोजन, जड़ी-बूटी चिकित्सा, हस्तशिल्प, उद्यम, आ युवा पीढ़ी कें स्वदेशी ज्ञान कें संचरण सहित विभिन्न विषयक पर प्रस्तुति देल गेलय.कार्यशाला केरऽ प्राथमिक उद्देश्य अध्ययन क्षेत्र म॑ जलवायु कार्यवाही म॑ आदिवासी महिला सिनी के भूमिका आरू योगदान प॑ अध्ययन केरऽ प्रारंभिक निष्कर्ष के खुलासा करना छेलै ।एकरऽ अलावा, एकरऽ उद्देश्य स्थानीय सरकार के प्रतिनिधि, आदिवासी संगठन, आरू सामुदायिक बुजुर्ग आरू नेता सहित प्रमुख उत्तरदाता आरू हितधारकऽ स॑ ई निष्कर्षऽ प॑ बहुमूल्य प्रतिक्रिया मँगना छेलै ।&quot;युवा महिला सिनी क॑ अक्सर हमरऽ पारंपरिक ज्ञान, सांस्कृतिक मूल्य, संस्कार, आरू उत्सव के महत्व के बारे म॑ जागरूकता के कमी छै. एक गणनाक के रूप म॑ काम करी क॑, हमरा अपनऽ सांस्कृतिक मूल्यऽ के सुरक्षा के अवसर के अंतर्दृष्टि आरू सराहना मिललै छै. हमरा आशा छै कि अन्य युवा सिनी क॑ हमरऽ स॑ समुदाय भी ऐन्हऽ अवसरऽ प॑ पहुँची सकै छै, जेकरा स॑ अंतर-पीढ़ी के ज्ञान आरू मूल्य स्थानांतरण क॑ बढ़ावा मिलै छै,” बरदिया केरऽ थारू मूल निवासी युवा आरू ग्रामीण विकास केरऽ स्नातक छात्रा सुश्री सुरक्ष्य चौधरी न॑ कहलकै, जे शोध प॑ काम करलकै ।ई आयोजन म॑ एक प्रदर्शनी भी शामिल छेलै जेकरा म॑ स्वदेशी बीज, भोजन, पौधा, आरू पारंपरिक हस्तशिल्प क॑ थारू, मगर, गुरुंग, आरू बायांसी सौका आदिवासी समुदाय स॑ प्रदर्शित करलऽ गेलऽ छेलै ।एतबे नै, प्रतिभागी कोलाज प्रदर्शन सत्र में संलग्न, प्रत्येक समुदाय सं चित्र के विभिन्न विषय में उपलब्ध कराबैत अपन गाम के वर्तमान स्थिति के बारे में अंतर्दृष्टि प्रदान करैत छल.“हमरा सब क॑ अपनऽ समुदाय म॑ कोनो भी धन या गतिविधि के बारे म॑ जानकारी नै देलऽ जाय छै; अतः, हमनें परियोजना गतिविधियऽ म॑ बहुत कम शामिल होय जाय छै, आरू सौका महिला के प्रतिनिधित्व स्थानीय स्तर प॑ शायद ही वहाँ छै,&quot; ई आयोजन के दौरान सुश्री मंजू बुधथोकी, एक सौका स्वदेशी न॑ बतैलकै । महिला एवं सदस्य ब्यानसी सौका समाज।मधुवान नगरपालिका के मेयर श्री तेजुर भाट के समापन टिप्पणी के साथ परिणत भेल बरदिया जे युवा पीढ़ी के माध्यम स अपन निरंतरता पर जोर दैत स्वदेशी सांस्कृतिक मूल्य, कौशल, आ प्रथा के संरक्षण के महत्व के रेखांकित केलनि।कुल मिलाकय दू दिन के कार्यशाला म॑ आदिवासी महिला आरू युवा सिनी स॑ सक्रिय भागीदारी के गवाह छेलै, जेकरा म॑ पर्याप्त चर्चा के बढ़ावा देलऽ गेलै आरू शोध अध्ययन म॑ बहुमूल्य इनपुट उपलब्ध कराय देलऽ गेलै ।"

In a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in Beijing on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that she was aware of the change in the power equation in Nepal and said that she hoped it would work for political stability and economic progress.

""China has been informed about the formation of a new power equation and the reorganization of the Cabinet in Nepal,"" she said, adding, “We hope that the relevant parties of the alliance will unite and advance the work of forming a new government and bring about political stability, economic growth and improvement in the people's livelihoods.”

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China said that it wanted to work in a way that would benefit the citizens of both countries while answering the questions posed by the Chinese media Global Times at the regular press conference.

Spokesperson Mao said that China attaches great importance to its relationship with Nepal as a neighboring friend and cooperative partner, and is ready to cooperate with the new government based on peaceful coexistence.

""We want to maintain the five principles of peaceful coexistence with the new government, deepen our traditional friendship, strengthen practical cooperation, advance the strategic partnership of cooperation with lasting friendship for development and prosperity, and provide more benefits to the citizens of both countries,"" she said.

China is the first country to react after the change in Nepal's power equation on Sunday.","{'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/South-China-Sea.jpg', 'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/South-China-Sea2.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709617923_yumyum-1200x560_20240305180737.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709707795_samajbadischiwalaya-1200x560_20240306153413.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-nagarik.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/PLANE_20230727144957.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/google.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-purbeli.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-paschameli.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Sheetal_Niwas.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Pathivara_20201018114959.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/MaoNing_20240306124634.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/CPN-UML_20220523122151.jpg', 'https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=KvIUm1aMp4Z3WR', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709713199_raswapa-1200x560_20240306145146.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/barshamanPun_20211126132319.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/logo-login.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/LumbiniProvincialAssembly_20210902121301.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/my-city/image/mycity-logo.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/left-alliance_Feb13.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/app-design.png', 'http://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/media/cache/nagarik_thumbnail_458_364/uploads/media/2018/January/Trumpjan917.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709700088_deuwaaaa-1200x560_20240306122623.jpg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/1709715907_thapaliyapatrisiameet-1200x560_20240306161947.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/logo.png', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/shareincrease_20220215172520.jpeg', 'https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/uploads/media/Arrest_20210131094327.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/myrepublica-logo11.png', 'https://news.google.com/bundles/nagarikfrontend/images/footer-shukrabar.png'}","काठमांडू, 6 मार्च : चीन न॑ ई आशा व्यक्त करल॑ छै कि नेपाल म॑ बनलऽ नया गठबंधन सरकार स॑ सत्ता समीकरण म॑ बदलाव आरू राजनीतिक स्थिरता मिलतै ।मंगलवार क॑ बीजिंग म॑ चीन केरऽ विदेश मंत्रालय द्वारा आयोजित एगो नियमित प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस म॑ विदेश मंत्रालय केरऽ प्रवक्ता माओ निंग न॑ कहलकै कि ओकरा नेपाल म॑ सत्ता समीकरण म॑ बदलाव के बारे म॑ पता छै आरू कहलकै कि ओकरा उम्मीद छै कि ई राजनीतिक स्थिरता लेली काम करतै आरू ओकरा आर्थिक प्रगति।हुनी कहलकै, “चीन क॑ एगो नया सत्ता समीकरण केरऽ गठन आरू नेपाल म॑ कैबिनेट केरऽ पुनर्गठन के बारे म॑ सूचित करलऽ गेलऽ छै, ई लेली हमरा आशा छै कि गठबंधन केरऽ संबंधित दलऽ क॑ एकजुट करतै आरू नया सरकार के गठन के काम क॑ आगू बढ़ाबै के काम आरू आगू बढ़तै आरू लोकक आजीविका मे राजनीतिक स्थिरता, आर्थिक विकास आ सुधार आनब।”चीन केरऽ विदेश मंत्रालय न॑ कहलकै कि हुनी ऐन्हऽ तरीका स॑ काम करना चाहै छै जेकरा स॑ चीन केरऽ मीडिया ग्लोबल टाइम्स न॑ नियमित प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस म॑ पूछलऽ गेलऽ सवालऽ के जवाब दै के साथ-साथ दोनों देशऽ के नागरिकऽ क॑ फायदा पहुँचैतै ।प्रवक्ता माओ न॑ कहलकै कि चीन न॑ पड़ोसी दोस्त आरू सहकारी भागीदार के रूप म॑ नेपाल के साथ अपनऽ संबंध क॑ बहुत महत्व दै छै, आरू शांतिपूर्ण सह-अस्तित्व के आधार प॑ नया सरकार के साथ सहयोग करै लेली तैयार छै ।&quot;हम नयका सरकार के साथ शांतिपूर्ण सह-अस्तित्व के पांच सिद्धांत कायम रखना चाहै छियै, हमरऽ पारंपरिक दोस्ती क॑ गहरा करै, व्यावहारिक सहयोग क॑ मजबूत करै, विकास आरू समृद्धि लेली स्थायी दोस्ती के साथ सहयोग के सामरिक साझेदारी क॑ आगू बढ़ाबै ल॑ चाहै छियै, आरू दोनों देशऽ के नागरिकऽ क॑ आरू लाभ प्रदान करना चाहै छियै, &quot; ओ बजलीह।नेपाल केरऽ बिजली समीकरण म॑ रविवार क॑ बदलाव के बाद चीन पहलऽ देश छै ।"

We are now on Season 3 Episode 1 of Nepal’s promiscuous political saga.

The Maoists and the UML have joined hands for the second time in a year to form a new leftist-led coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal of the Maoist Centre has replaced the NC with the UML and the United Socialists.

Dahal may say about the NC having double crossed him, but this was all about ensuring that he remains Prime Minister for another year instead of having to rotate it with Deuba and Nepal before the next election in 2027. Now, he just has to hand over to Oli next year.

This is all déjà vu. Dahal and Oli had a ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ on rotating premiership after the 2017 election, and the Maoists merged with the UML to form the NCP. But both ended up stabbing each other in the back, and Oli had to step down. Why should it be any different this time?

The more things change in Nepali politics, the more they remain the same. The same three men of the three main parties have been playing musical chairs for most of the 18 years after the end of the conflict.

The cartoon by Diwakar Chhetri (above) was used in Nepali Times in 2020 when K P Oli was being catapulted to Singha Darbar. For this edition, we just exchanged him for Dahal, added Rabi Lamichhane of the RSP and changed the guy playing marbles to Deuba.

On Wednesday, the new coalition included the Maoists, UML, RSP, CPN (US) with the JSP still undecided. But in Nepal’s cybersphere, there is little excitement that this will change anything and the new lineup has been met mostly with ridicule.

Even a new party like the RSP under Lamichhane is behaving like an old party because he is in a tearing hurry to get on the fast-track to Singha Darbar. He angled for and got the Home Minister’s portfolio, while Barsaman Pun of the Maoists is Finance Minister. The JSP's Upendra Yadav is said to have wanted the Foreign Ministry, but the portfolio went to Narayan Kaji Shrestha.

That this is all about getting to power and staying there could not have been clearer because everyone is angling for the powerful ministries with the biggest discretionary funds.

UML Chief Whip Padam Giri has been named Minister for Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affiars after serving just 40 days as Health Minister during the previous Maoist-UML coalition. Hit Bahadur Tamang of the Maoists is Tourism and Civil Aviation Minister. The RSP’s Dol Prasad Aryal returns to the Labour Ministry despite conflict of interest allegations during his last stint because of his alleged involvement in recruitment and remittance companies.

The Unified Socialists say they are getting two ministries, including Federal and Social Service. The RSP’s Sumana Shrestha is Education Minister and Biraj Bhakta Shrestha Youth and Sports.

Lamichhane’s insistence on the Home Ministry portfolio is said to stem from a desire to exculpate himself from multiple controversies about citizenship and his investment in a cooperative that cheated depositors.

Monday’s political earthquake in Kathmandu has sent aftershocks to all seven provincial governments. The provinces all have their own party arithmetics in their assemblies, yet they are unduly impacted by what happens to the federal government. This is not how devolution is supposed to work.

Under federalism, Nepali politics is even more centralised than before with province politicians beholden not just to their party in Kathmandu, but to the head honcho in each of them for instructions. Which is why NC ministers have resigned in Karnali, and the NC controlled provincial governments in Gandaki and Sudur Paschim have sacked Maoist ministers.

Unlike the previous coalition, the main parties in the current coalition at least have similar sounding names like Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), Communist Party of Nepal (United Socialists). This could be a formidable leftist front in the 2027 election.

All this must be music to the ears of the Chinese, who have made no secret of their wish that Nepal’s Communists parties should all merge. And if the Chinese want that, then automatically the US-India bloc is not going to be too pleased.

The Maoist-NC coalition was seen to be better suited to India, but while this week’s change would have been a surprise for New Delhi, it may not have been a shock, since it is quite comfortable also with Prime Minister Dahal.","{'https://news.google.com/img/social-ig.svg', 'https://news.google.com/img/social-tw.svg',

Antima runs her business out of a modest roadside hut, selling samosas and other varieties of fried, savory items. Her hands move deftly as she prepares the dough and fillings, her face a mask of concentration.

The program offers a mix of social and financial skills training including communication, negotiation, self-assessment and resource identification

Antima first had the idea for the business last year when she took part in the Rupantaran life skills program. Developed by UNICEF and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in collaboration with the Government of Nepal, and implemented with support from partners including Zonta International and David Beckham's 7 Fund for UNICEF, the Rupantaran package is aimed at providing adolescents between 10 to 19 years of age with the information and skills they need to navigate society and plan for their futures.

The package includes a mix of social and financial skills training and covers a wide range of topics such as communication, negotiation, self-assessment and resource identification for goal attainment and physical and mental well-being, all taught by locally based facilitators or peer educators over the course of 21 weeks.

Antima, one of seven siblings, had dropped out after fifth grade because her family’s financial situation was so dire. She had been staying home, helping her parents take care of her younger siblings when she was approached by a Rupantaran facilitator with an invitation to join the sessions. Having long felt aimless, she says she was curious about what the opportunity entailed and decided to give it a shot.

That decision turned things around for her.

A dream come true

As she attended the Rupantaran sessions, Antima started to get excited about what she was learning, particularly the module on economic empowerment and entrepreneurship.

""My parents used to own a small eatery, and I had grown up watching my father make these dishes, even helped him,"" she says. ""I felt that this was something I could do too.""

And so, after completing the Rupantaran course, Antima applied for seed funding to start her business and, following an interview, was among those selected to receive a sum of NPR 10,000 (approx. USD $75). With the money in hand and the financial skills she picked up in the Rupantaran program, the snack shop was soon up and running.

Today, Antima says she earns around NPR 700 (approx. USD $5.25) a day. While she is glad that this allows her to contribute to the family’s income, it is being able to pay for her younger siblings’ education, especially that of her little sister, that brings her the most joy.

""My parents couldn't afford to send us to school"" she says. ""My older sisters were already married, but my younger siblings still have a chance.""

My parents couldn't afford to send us to school. My older sisters were already married, but my younger siblings still have a chance. — Antima, 16

A different future

While the Rupantaran program places a strong emphasis on education, and as a first priority, encourages participating adolescents to continue or resume formal schooling after graduating, it also recognizes that this option might not be viable for all — especially older adolescents who might struggle to transition to classrooms with much younger counterparts.

In these cases, especially when they demonstrate an interest and aptitude for entrepreneurship, the young people are guided accordingly, and provided the skills-building and mentoring support they need to establish and sustain micro-enterprises of their choice.

A chance to make their own choices in life

Over the past four years, more than 93,000 adolescents have been reached through the radio version of the Rupantaran program, and 8,473 adolescents have participated through school and community-based sessions.

Ruby Kumari Ram, one of the Rupantaran facilitators, says that for many of these girls who come from marginalized communities, the Rupantaran class represents the only opportunity they might have to choose a different future for themselves than the one their families or society has chosen for them. That gradual broadening of their horizons — beyond the narrow, limited prospects that they are otherwise forced to live with — that is the beauty of Rupantaran, in Ruby's opinion.

""It makes me very happy to play a part in helping them understand themselves better, set their goals and make their own choices in life,"" Ruby says.

As speculation is rife that Beijing is behind the new political change in Nepal, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Tuesday that China is ready to work with the new government in Nepal.

Breaking the year-long political alliance with the Nepali Congress, Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal a.k.a. Prachanda reorganised his Cabinet on Monday by ousting Nepal’s grand old party, and inducting the CPN-UML and Rastriya Swatantra Party.

China is willing to work with the new Nepali government, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said during a regular press conference in Beijing on Tuesday.

“We sincerely hope that all the parties in Nepal will unite and cooperate to smoothly advance the work related to the formation of a new government and achieve political stability, economic development, and improvement of people's livelihood,” the spokesperson said.

After snapping the alliance with the Nepali Congress, Prachanda on Monday inducted three ministers in the new Cabinet, one from his party CPN (Maoist Centre), one from CPN-UML, and a third from the Rastriya Swatantra Party.

After Prachanda decided to break the alliance with the Nepali Congress, it is all set to withdraw its support by Tuesday itself.

As a friendly neighbour and cooperative partner, China attaches great importance to Nepal-China relations and is willing to work with the new Nepali government to adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence, enhance traditional friendship, deepen pragmatic cooperation, and promote Nepal-China strategic cooperation for ever-lasting friendship oriented towards development and prosperity, Ning said.

China is facing several controversies in Kathmandu for failing to expedite the projects under the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI), not completing the projects undertaken by the Chinese companies and contractors, on the issue of corruption, and the ongoing investigation into one ambitious airport which was built on a loan by China, among others.

China is in a very awkward position in Kathmandu and was hell-bent to reorganise the two major Communist parties - UML and Maoist Centre - so that its image could be improved in Nepal.","{'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/sme-top-logo.jpg', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/poll1.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/cmsmedia/images/favorites.png', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/common/twticon-for-sme.png', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/poll.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/subscribe.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/cmsmedia/images/print.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/cmsmedia/smetimes/media/2008/03/26/nepal-flag.jpg', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/logo-tradeindia.jpg', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/banners/0/040/510.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/side-bg.gif', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/smenews/favicon.ico', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/cmsmedia/smetimes/media/2008/03/26/nepal-flagTHMB.jpg', 'https://tiimg.tistatic.com/new_website1/common/fbicon-for-sme.png'}","आईएएन |06 मार्च, 2024 के रूप म॑ अटकलबाजी छै कि नेपाल म॑ नया राजनीतिक परिवर्तन के पीछू बीजिंग के पीछे छै, ई बात क॑ चीन न॑ मंगलवार क॑ कहलकै कि चीन नेपाल म॑ नया सरकार के साथ काम करै लेली तैयार छै ।नेपाली कांग्रेस के साथ साल भर के राजनीतिक गठबंधन के तोड़ी क नेपाल के प्रधानमंत्री पुष्पा कमल दाहल उर्फ ​​प्रचंडा नेपाल के भव्य पुरान पार्टी के सत्ता सं मुक्त क अपन मंत्रिमंडल के पुनर्गठन केलनि, आ सीपीएन-उमाल आ रस्त्रिय स्वतानत्र पार्टी के शामिल केलनि।चीन केरऽ विदेश मंत्रालय केरऽ प्रवक्ता माओ निंग न॑ मंगलवार क॑ बीजिंग म॑ आयोजित एगो नियमित प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस के दौरान कहलकै कि चीन नयका नेपाली सरकार के साथ काम करै लेली तैयार छै ।प्रवक्ता नँ कहलकै, “हमरा सब क ईमानदारी स आशा छै कि नेपाल मँ सब दल एकजुट होय क सहयोग करतै ताकि नया सरकार के गठन स॑ संबंधित काम क॑ सुचारू रूप स॑ आगू बढ़ाबै आरू राजनीतिक स्थिरता, आर्थिक विकास, आरू लोगऽ के आजीविका म॑ सुधार हासिल करलऽ जाय ।नेपाली कांग्रेस के साथ गठबंधन के बाद प्रचंडा न॑ सोमवार क॑ नयका कैबिनेट म॑ तीन मंत्री, एक क॑ अपनऽ पार्टी सीपीएन (माओवादी केंद्र) म॑ शामिल करी लेलकै, जेकरा म॑ एक सीपीएन-यूएमएल केरऽ आरू एक तिहाई रस्तिया स्वातात्रा पार्टी केरऽ छै ।प्रचंडा नेपाली कांग्रेस के साथ गठबंधन तोड़ै के फैसला के बाद ई सब मंगलवार तक अपनऽ समर्थन वापस लेबै के तैयारी में छै ।एक दोस्ताना पड़ोसी आरू सहकारी भागीदार के रूप म॑ चीन नेपाल-चीन संबंधऽ क॑ बहुत महत्व दै छै आरू शांतिपूर्ण सह-अस्तित्व के पांच सिद्धांतऽ के पालन करै, पारंपरिक दोस्ती बढ़ाबै, व्यावहारिक सहयोग क॑ गहरा करै, आरू नेपाल-चीन क॑ बढ़ावा दै लेली नया नेपाली सरकार के साथ काम करै लेली तैयार छै । निंग न॑ कहलकै कि विकास आरू समृद्धि के तरफ उन्मुख नित्य चललऽ दोस्ती लेली सामरिक सहयोग ।चीन क॑ काठमांडू म॑ कई विवादऽ के सामना करना पड़॑ छै, कैन्हेंकि चीनी कंपनी आरू ठेकेदारऽ द्वारा करलऽ गेलऽ परियोजना क॑ पूरा नै करलऽ गेलऽ छै, आरू एक महत्वाकांक्षी हवाई अड्डा केरऽ जारी जांच प॑ । चीन द्वारा एकटा लोन पर बनल छल, अन्य के संग।चीन काठमांडू में बहुत अजीब स्थिति में छै आरू दू प्रमुख कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी - उमल आरू माओवादी केंद्र - के पुनर्गठन लेली नरक-बेंट छेलै, जेकरा स॑ नेपाल में एकरऽ छवि में सुधार करलऽ जाब॑ सकै छै ।"
Subarna Shrestha: Nurturing the future of Hockey in Nepal - Asian Hockey Federation,Subarna Shrestha: Nurturing the future of Hockey in Nepal  Asian Hockey Federation,2024-03-06 15:07:50,https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuYXNpYWhvY2tleS5vcmcvbmV3cy9zdWJhcm5hLXNocmVzdGhhLW51cnR1cmluZy10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLWhvY2tleS1pbi1uZXBhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en,http://www.asiahockey.org,Asian Hockey Federation,"the lead up to the International Women’s Day 2024, a year that marks 100 years of the International Hockey Federation (FIH), we are speaking with women in hockey, who have made major contributions towards the growth of the sport over the past few decades.

In today’s story, we feature Subarna Shrestha, recently elected Secretary General of Nepal Hockey Association, and long-term administrator with the Asian Hockey Federation.

Hockey was Subarna’s favourite sport throughout her childhood. She grew up watching the sport on television and always harboured a dream of getting involved with the sport. “Watching the game on TV proved to be extremely entertaining. The tactful and elegant stick skills of Dhanraj Pillay, Tahir Zaman, Shahbaz Ahmed kept me glued to the screen. As hockey activities were limited while I was growing up in Nepal, my dream has been to develop and promote the sport in Nepal, so more people could play it.”

Having followed and been involved in hockey for a long time, Subarna has had a front row seat to the evolution of the game. She believes evolution and innovation is good for the sport and highlights some of the changes she believes have been crucial over the years: “The shift from two halves to four quarters made the game faster and more interesting to watch. Also use of personal protection equipment made the game much safer for the players. The introduction of newer formats; indoor hockey and Hockey5s have made the sport popular among the youth, specially the speed with which Hockey5s is played seems to be favoured by young players.”

Speaking on the importance of a community in developing sport, Subarna said, “In a hockey developing nation like Nepal not everything goes as planned and sometimes the plan takes longer than expected to execute. In recent times, we have received support from local government authorities as well as local sports authorities. We have acquired land necessary to build an artificial turf stadium – the first of its kind in Nepal – with support from Dhulikhel Municipality. The support and encouragement from our players, association members and other stakeholders provides us energy to do more.”

Gender equality in hockey is a core value for Subarna. She was thrilled when hockey became among the first sports to utilise mixed-gender umpires and greatly admired the recent change in Kit Regulations to allow players to wear shorts, skorts, or skirts, giving athletes the personal choice in their playing kit for international hockey. However, she believes there is more that can be achieved in the future, when it comes to women’s participation in sports administration. “Obtaining gender equality and maintaining gender balance not only in participation on field, but also in administrative roles. Currently many of us are focusing on maintaining gender balance in players but we are omitting the maintaining of gender balance in administrative and support roles (coaching/officiating/ administrative/other support roles). Maintaining balance helps not only promote the sport but also in developing a shared vision that portrays both men and women equally.”

On a personal note, Subarna speaks of the joy hockey continues to bring her on a daily basis. “Hockey has brought me a lot of joy. From watching a young boy/girl receive their first new kit, to witnessing an athlete jumping in joy on receiving their first international cap to represent their nation. Helping the athletes in the various aspects of life to realise their hockey dream gives me immense joy.”

Asked about what advice she would give to the next generation of hockey enthusiasts, Subarna said: “There will be obstacles along the way. The obstacles you face will help you become stronger and better. Don’t lose hope. Things may not always happen as expected and you will keep facing different challenges. Believe in yourself, be smart, be patient, practise your skills and everything will come to you at the right time.”","{'http://www.asiahockey.org/wp-content/plugins/phastpress/phast.php/c2VydmljZT1pbWFnZXMmc3JjPWh0dHAlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cuYXNpYWhvY2tleS5vcmclMkZ3cC1jb250ZW50JTJGdXBsb2FkcyUyRjIwMTYlMkYxMiUyRkFIRi1Mb2dvLVdlYnNpdGUtZm9vdGVyLnBuZyZjYWNoZU1hcmtlcj0xNjgzMjgyMjI3LTEzODUxJnRva2VuPTVkNWZhNTY0MDBmNTY0ZTg.q.png',

Kathmandu: Eighteen ministers were sworn into office in Nepal on Wednesday after the prime minister forged a new communist coalition by sacking old allies, the latest shakeup in Kathmandu's volatile parliament.

Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, 69, an ex-Maoist guerrilla better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda or ""the fierce one"", leads the Maoist Centre party, the third largest in the 275-member parliament.

He fell out with his former partners, the centrist Nepali Congress (NC), and the largest party in parliament. They now form the opposition.

Dahal has instead rebuilt an alliance with the Communist Party Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML), led by former prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli, viewed as being pro-China.

""Eighteen new ministers from four parties are taking their oath... and will assume their office,"" said Govinda Acharya, the prime minister's press advisor.

Nepal, a Himalayan nation of 30 million people, is sandwiched between powerful neighbours India and China -- with both New Delhi and Beijing campaigning for influence.

Kathmandu has sought to balance ties while boosting its economy.

The ministers were sworn into office by President Ram Chandra Poudel, with Maoist ministers Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Barsha Man Pun taking the foreign minister post and the finance minister post respectively.

Three ministers were sworn in on Monday.

The Maoists have dominated Nepal's politics for more than 20 years after waging a decade-long insurgency against government forces that claimed more than 16,000 lives.

The civil war ended in a 2006 peace deal, which saw rebel leader Dahal become Nepal's first post-war prime minister.

The three main parties -- the Maoists, CPN-UML, and the NC -- have since monopolised politics, forming varying brittle coalitions with one another.

Dahal allied with the Nepali Congress after the general election in 2022, following a rift with the CPN-UML over a presidential candidate. But he later switched his alliance back to the CPN-UML after facing difficulties working with the NC.","{'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240305_1709619654-462-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709619654', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/logo-fot-v2.png', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240302_1709390964-63-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1709390964', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709747859-675-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709747859', 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/08exJXgS24c/hqdefault.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709746623-75-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709746623', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/logo-v2.png', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709742763-506-thumb_small_92.jpeg?1709742764', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709706633-999-thumb_315.jpg?1709706633', 'https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/get/maximage/20240306_1709747859-675.jpg?1709747859', 'https://news.google.com/get/maximage/20231108_1699430230-900.jpeg?1699430230', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240304_1709551709-949-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709551710', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240305_1709636985-254-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1709636985', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240227_1709052128-967-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1709052128', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709721625-808-thumb_small_190.jpg?1709721625', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20230227_1677498119-172-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1677498119', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240306_1709746164-125-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709746164', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240301_1709275452-762-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709275452', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240229_1709239238-515-thumb_small_190.jpg?1709239238', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240305_1709623913-955-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709623913', 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/ylIIRjQb8BU/hqdefault.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20220920_1663668404-192-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1663668404', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240302_1709375653-495-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709375653', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/dar-logo-white-en-02-02.svg', 'https://img.youtube.com/vi/kGyDXSJstd4/hqdefault.jpg', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240305_1709666963-221-thumb_small_190.jpeg?1709666963', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20220630_1656566686-177-thumb_small_92.jpg?1656566687', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/google_icon.svg', 'https://news.google.com/get/maximage/20240306_1709747859-675.jpg?1709747859', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/logo-p.png', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/pdf.png', 'https://news.google.com/get/image/20240305_1709650261-143-thumb_small_92.jpg?1709650261', 'https://news.google.com/assets/cdn/images/Classifieds.jpg'}","राम चंद्र पौडेल एएफपी काठमांडू केरऽ फाइल फोटो : प्रधानमंत्री न॑ काठमांडू केरऽ अस्थिर संसद म॑ ताजा शेकअप क॑ बर्खास्त करी क॑ प्रधानमंत्री न॑ बुधवार क॑ नेपाल म॑ बुधवार क॑ नेपाल म॑ शपथ लेलकै ।प्रधानमंत्री पुष्पा कमल दहल (69), एक पूर्व मओवादी गुरिल्ला जे अपन नोम डी गुएरे प्रचंडा या &quot;द उग्र&quot; द्वारा बेसी जानल जाइत अछि, 275 सदस्यीय संसद मे तेसर सबसँ पैघ माओवादी सेंटर पार्टी के नेतृत्व करैत अछि ।ओ अपन पूर्व साझेदार, सेंट्रिस्ट नेपाली कांग्रेस (एनसी) आ संसद मे सबस पैघ पार्टी क संग खसि पड़लाह ।आब ओ सभ विरोध बनबैत छथि।दाहल न॑ एकरऽ बदला म॑ कम्युनिस्ट पार्टी नेपाल-एकीकृत मार्क्सवादी लेनिनवादी (सीपीएन-यूएमएल) के साथ गठबंधन के पुनर्निर्माण करलकै, जेकरऽ नेतृत्व पूर्व प्रधानमंत्री केपी शर्मा ओली करी रहलऽ छै, जेकरा समर्थक चीन के रूप म॑ देखलऽ जाय छै ।प्रधानमंत्री प्रेस सलाहकार गोविन्द आचार्य कहलनि जे, चारि दल के अग्रह मंत्री अपन शपथ लेलनि... आ अपन पद ग्रहण करताह।3 करोड़ लोगऽ के हिमालयी राष्ट्र नेपाल स॑ शक्तिशाली पड़ोसी भारत आरू चीन के बीच सैंडविच करलऽ गेलऽ छै -- जेकरा म॑ नई दिल्ली आरू बीजिंग दोनों के प्रभाव लेली अभियान छै ।काठमांडू अपन अर्थव्यवस्था कए बढ़ावा दैत संबंध कए संतुलित करबाक प्रयास केलक अछि।राष्ट्रपति राम चन्द्र पौडेल द्वारा मंत्री सब के पद पर शपथ लेल गेल छल, जाहि में माओवादी मंत्री नारायण काजी श्रेस्थ आ बरशा मैन पुन के क्रमशः विदेश मंत्री पद आ वित्त मंत्री पद के लेल गेलनि।तीन मंत्री सोमदिन शपथ लेलक।16,000 स॑ भी अधिक लोगऽ के जीवन के दावा करै वाला सरकारी ताकतऽ के खिलाफ दशक भर के विद्रोह के काम करला के बाद माओवादी सिनी न॑ 20 साल स॑ भी अधिक समय स॑ नेपाल केरऽ राजनीति प॑ हावी होय रहलऽ छै ।गृहयुद्ध २००६ केरऽ शांति सौदा म॑ समाप्त होय गेलै, जेकरा म॑ विद्रोही के नेता दहल न॑ नेपाल केरऽ युद्ध के बाद के प्रधानमंत्री बनी गेलै ।तीनू मुख्य दल -- माओवादी, सीपीएन-यूएमएल, आ एनसी -- तखन सं राजनीति पर एकाधिकार बना देलक अछि, एक दोसरा सं अलग-अलग भंगुर गठबंधन बनबैत अछि.दाहल न॑ २०२२ म॑ आम चुनाव के बाद नेपाली कांग्रेस के साथ गठबंधन करलकै, जेकरा म॑ राष्ट्रपति पद के उम्मीदवार प॑ सीपीएन-यूएमएल के साथ दरार के बाद एगो दरार छेलै ।लेकिन बाद म॑ एनसी के साथ काम करै म॑ दिक्कत के सामना करला के बाद हुनी अपनऽ गठबंधन वापस सीपीएन-यूएमएल म॑ बदली देलकै ।"
